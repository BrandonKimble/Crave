Single Database Transaction ‚Üí Quality Score Computation
```

### 1.4 Core System Architecture

#### 1.4.1 Processing Architecture

- **Modular component system**: Independent processors handle different entity combinations from LLM output
- **Dynamic query system**: Single adaptive SQL query that optimizes based on extracted entities
- **Background data collection**: Dual scheduled cycles (chronological collection + keyword entity search) plus on-demand query-driven collection
- **Real-time query processing**: Entity resolution ‚Üí dynamic query building ‚Üí result ranking

#### 1.4.2 Performance Strategy

- **Pre-computed quality scores**: Rankings calculated during data processing, not query time
- **Multi-level caching**: Hot queries (1hr), recent results (24hr), static data (7d+)
- **Single-phase processing**: Streamlined architecture eliminating intermediate JSON structures
- **Batch operations**: Bulk entity resolution, database updates, and mention processing
- **Geographic optimization**: Map-based filtering applied before ranking for performance

### 1.5 Data Collection & Knowledge Synthesis

#### 1.5.1 Community Content Processing

- **Reddit discussion analysis**: Extract dish-restaurant connections, attributes, and sentiment from food community posts/comments
- **Organic category emergence**: Food categories develop naturally from community language patterns rather than predetermined hierarchies
- **Multi-source mention aggregation**: Combine mentions across posts, comments, and discussion threads for comprehensive evidence

#### 1.5.2 Dynamic Ranking & Relevance

- **Quality score evolution**: Dish and restaurant rankings improve with additional community evidence over time
- **Activity indicators**: Real-time trending (üî•) and active (üïê) status based on mention recency patterns
- **Contextual performance scoring**: Restaurant rankings adapt based on query context (category/attribute-specific performance vs. global scores)

### 3.2 Architecture Benefits & Tooling Integration

#### 3.2.1 Hybrid Approach Advantages

**Turborepo Monorepo Benefits:**

- **Build Optimization**: Parallel builds, intelligent caching, dependency orchestration
- **Code Sharing**: Shared packages in `packages/` for common types and utilities
- **Developer Experience**: Single repository, unified tooling, consistent development workflow
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new apps (admin dashboard, analytics, etc.)

**Modular Monolith Benefits:**

- **Business Domain Separation**: Clear boundaries between content processing, search, user experience
- **Team Autonomy**: Teams can work independently within domain boundaries
- **Shared Infrastructure**: Common database, caching, monitoring across all domains
- **Deployment Simplicity**: Single API deployment while maintaining internal modularity

#### 3.2.2 Shared Package Strategy

**`@crave-search/shared`** provides shared types and constants across API and mobile apps.

**Contains:**

- Entity types (graph-based model from Section 4.1)
- API request/response types
- Application constants

**Usage:**

```typescript
import { EntityType, ENTITY_TYPES } from '@crave-search/shared';
```

#### 3.2.3 Developer Workflows

**Essential Commands:**

```bash
# Development
pnpm dev                       # Start all apps
pnpm --filter api dev         # API only

# Services
pnpm --filter api docker:up    # PostgreSQL + Redis
pnpm --filter api prisma:studio # Database browser

# Database
turbo run db:migrate          # Run migrations
turbo run db:generate         # Generate Prisma client
pnpm --filter api db:seed      # Seed test data

# Quality
turbo run lint                # Lint all
turbo run type-check         # TypeScript check
```

### 3.3 Domain Responsibilities

#### 3.3.1 Content Processing

Handles all aspects of ingesting and analyzing community content

- **Workflow Orchestration**: Coordinate reddit-collector ‚Üí llm-processor ‚Üí entity-resolver workflow
- **Metric Aggregation**: Update connection metrics when new mentions are processed
- **Score Computation**: Calculate global quality scores after connection metrics are updated
- **Background Job Management**: Schedule and manage systematic content processing operations

#### 3.3.2 Search & Discovery

Manages query processing and result delivery using pre-computed data

- **Result Ranking**: Retrieve and apply stored global quality scores for fast ranking
- **Query Optimization**: Use pre-computed scores and activity levels for sub-second responses
- **Discovery Features**: Leverage activity indicators computed during data processing

#### 3.3.3 Supporting Domains

**User Experience**: Focuses on user-facing features and interactions
**External Integrations**: Centralizes third-party service connections
**Infrastructure**: Provides foundational system services

### 3.4 Development and Design Principles

#### 3.4.1 Balanced Architecture: DI for Infrastructure, FP for Business Logic

- **Strategic Dependency Injection**: Use NestJS DI container for stateful services, lifecycle management, and cross-cutting concerns (database connections, external APIs, logging, caching)
- **Functional Programming for Pure Logic**: Implement business rules, data transformations, and calculations as pure functions without DI overhead
- **Utility-First Approach**: Simple operations (deduplication, merging, validation) implemented as utility functions, not injectable services
- **Event-Driven Decoupling**: Replace excessive service-to-service dependencies with event-based communication where appropriate
- **Schema-Based Validation**: Use Zod schemas for runtime validation instead of custom validator services

#### 3.4.2 Event-Driven Communication

- **Asynchronous operations**: If performant, use events for background processing and cross-module notifications
- **Score update events**: If performant, emit events when process-orchestrator completes mention processing to trigger downstream updates
- **User activity events**: Track search patterns and bookmark changes for personalization
- **Decoupled notifications**: Use event bus for sending alerts and updates without tight coupling

#### 3.4.3 Performance-First Architecture

- **Pre-computed rankings**: Calculate all scores right after each content processing cycle, not query time
- **Strategic caching**: Cache at multiple levels (query results, entity data, computed scores)
- **Bulk operations**: Process entities and mentions in batches for database efficiency
- **Background processing**: Move heavy computation (LLM analysis, score calculation) to process-orchestrator

#### 3.4.4 Code Organization Best Practices

- **Domain-driven structure**: Organize code by business domain, not technical layer
- **Single responsibility**: Each module has clear, focused purpose
- **Shared infrastructure**: Common concerns (database, caching, monitoring) centralized in infrastructure domain
- **Testability**: Design for easy unit testing with mocked dependencies and clear interfaces

#### 3.4.5 Monorepo Guidelines

**Dependency Rules:**

- ‚úÖ Apps can import packages (`apps/api` ‚Üí `@crave-search/shared`)
- ‚ùå Packages cannot import apps (maintains package independence)
- ‚úÖ Packages can import other packages (for composition)

**Code Placement:**

- **Shared package**: Types, constants, utilities used by multiple apps
- **App-specific**: Framework code, environment config, business logic

## 4. Data Model & Database Architecture

### 4.1 Core Database Schema

#### 4.1.1 Graph-Based Model

_**Note**: This design uses a unified entity-relationship model where all entities (restaurants, dishes, categories, attributes) are stored in a single `entities` table differentiated by type, with relationships modeled through the `connections` table. This approach enables flexible many-to-many relationships while maintaining referential integrity and query performance. These schemas may evolve during implementation as requirements are refined._

##### Entities Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE entities (
  entity_id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, -- Canonical normalized name
  type entity_type NOT NULL, -- 'restaurant', 'dish_or_category', 'dish_attribute', 'restaurant_attribute'
  aliases TEXT[] DEFAULT '{}', -- Original texts and known variations

  -- Restaurant-specific columns (null for non-restaurant entities)
  restaurant_attributes UUID[] DEFAULT '{}',
  restaurant_quality_score DECIMAL(10,4) DEFAULT 0,
  -- Google Places data
  latitude DECIMAL(10, 8),
  longitude DECIMAL(11, 8),
  address VARCHAR(500),
  google_place_id VARCHAR(255),
  restaurant_metadata JSONB DEFAULT '{}', -- For complex/infrequent google places data only

  last_updated TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,

  UNIQUE(name, type),

  last_updated TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,

  UNIQUE(restaurant_id, dish_or_category_id, dish_attributes), -- Prevent duplicate connections
  INDEX idx_connections_restaurant (restaurant_id),

### 4.2 Data Model Principles

#### 4.2.1 Graph-Based Unified Entity Model

- **Unified dish_or_category entities**: Serve dual purposes as specific menu items AND general food categories
- **Connection-scoped relationships**: Categories and dish attributes exist only within restaurant‚Üídish connections
- **Restaurant-scoped attributes**: Ambiance, features, and service qualities stored directly on restaurant entities
- **Evidence-driven connections**: All relationships backed by trackable community mentions with scoring
- **All connections are restaurant‚Üídish**: No direct category or attribute connections

#### 4.2.2 Entity Type Definitions

- **restaurant**: Physical dining establishments with location and operational data
- **dish_or_category**: Food items that can be both menu items and general categories
- **dish_attribute**: Connection-scoped descriptors that apply to dishes (spicy, vegan, house-made, Italian when describing dishes)
- **restaurant_attribute**: Restaurant-scoped descriptors that apply to restaurants (patio, romantic, family-friendly, Italian when describing restaurants)

**Context-Dependent Attributes**: Many attributes exist as separate entities based on their contextual scope. For example, "Italian" exists as both a dish_attribute entity (for Italian dishes) and a restaurant_attribute entity (for Italian restaurants), enabling precise query targeting and flexible cross-scope analysis.

### 4.3 Data Model Architecture

#### 4.3.1 Unified dish_or_category Entity Approach

- **Single entity type serves dual purposes**:
  - Node entity (when is_menu_item = true)
  - Connection-scope metadata (stored in categories array)
- **Same entity ID can represent both menu item and category**
- **Eliminates redundancy and ambiguity** in food terminology

#### 4.3.2 Context-Driven Attribute Entity Management

- **Separate entities by scope**: Context-dependent attributes (cuisine, dietary, value, etc.) exist as separate entities based on their scope
- **Scope-aware entity resolution**: Entity resolution matches by name AND scope to find the correct entity
- **Flexible query capabilities**: Enables precise filtering by restaurant attributes vs dish attributes
- **Examples**: "Italian" exists as both dish_attribute and restaurant_attribute entities with different IDs

#### 4.3.3 All Connections are Restaurant-to-dish_or_category

- **Restaurant attributes**: Stored as entity IDs in restaurant entity's metadata (restaurant_attributes: uuid[])
- **Dish attributes**: Connection-scoped entity IDs stored in dish_attributes array
- **Categories**: Connection-scoped entity IDs stored in categories array
- **Only restaurant-to-dish_or_category connections** exist in the connections table

#### 4.3.4 Categories in Connection Scope Only

- **Categories stored as entity ID references** in restaurant‚Üídish_or_category connections
- **Restaurant-category mentions boost scores** of all related dish_or_category items
- **Enables flexible categorization** without entity proliferation

## 5. Data Collection Strategy & Architecture

### 5.1 Data Collection Strategy

The system uses a hybrid approach combining comprehensive historical data from Pushshift archives with real-time Reddit API collection. This strategy addresses Reddit API limitations while maintaining both historical depth and real-time capabilities. Implementation details can be found in section 6.

#### 5.1.1 Initial Historical Load (Primary Foundation)

- **Data Source**: Pushshift archives via Academic Torrents (apps/api/data/pushshift)
- **Format**: zstd-compressed ndjson files (one JSON object per line)
- **Target Subreddits**: r/austinfood (primary), r/FoodNYC
- **Processing Method**: Stream processing line-by-line to handle large files without memory issues
- **Coverage**: Complete historical data through end-2024 without 1000-item limitations
- **Implementation**:
  - Download via torrent client (qBittorrent recommended)
  - Decompress using zstd libraries
  - Stream parse with Node.js readline interface
  - Extract entities/mentions via LLM pipeline
  - Build knowledge graph with full historical context
- **Timing**: One-time setup during development, processed in parallel with ongoing API collection
  - **Storage**: Local development (apps/api/data/pushshift/), S3 for production

#### 5.1.2 Ongoing Reddit API Collection

##### Purpose

Maintain real-time updates and capture new community content post-2024 using Reddit API through two complementary collection strategies.

##### Dual Collection Strategy

**Chronological Collection Cycles**

- **Purpose**: Complete recent coverage ensuring no content gaps
- **Method**: Fetch all recent posts chronologically using `/r/subreddit/new`
- **Dynamic Scheduling**: Collection frequency calculated per subreddit based on posting volume
  - Uses safety buffer equation: `safe_interval = (750_posts / avg_posts_per_day)`
  - Examples: r/austinfood (~15 posts/day) = 50 days, r/FoodNYC (~40 posts/day) = 18 days
  - Constraints: minimum 7 days, maximum 60 days between cycles
- **Implementation**: Track last_processed_timestamp, fetch all posts and comments since last cycle

**Keyword Entity Search Cycles**

- **Purpose**: Targeted historical enrichment for specific entities across all timeframes
- **Method**: Search using `/r/subreddit/search?q={entity}&sort=relevance&limit=1000`
- **Schedule**: Monthly, offset from chronological collection to distribute API usage
- **Entity Priority**: High-priority entities selected using priority scoring algorithm considering:
  - Data recency (days since last enrichment, new entity status)
  - Data quality (mention count, source diversity)
  - User demand (query frequency, high-potential entities)
- **Multi-Entity Coverage**: Searches all entity types (restaurants, dishes, attributes) creating comprehensive semantic net
- **Implementation**: Select top 20-30 entities monthly, fetch all comments for relevant posts

**Gap Minimization Strategy**

- **Start immediately**: Begin both collection strategies to minimize 2024-2025 gap
- **Bidirectional enrichment**: Chronological collection discovers new entities, keyword search provides historical context
- **Parallel processing**: Run alongside Pushshift archive processing
- **Overlap detection**: Merge data based on timestamps to avoid duplicates

##### Standard Process Flow

Both historical archive processing and ongoing Reddit API collection follow this unified process:

1. **Data Retrieval**

**Historical (Pushshift Archives):**

- Download and decompress zstd files
- Stream parse ndjson line-by-line
- Extract post/comment objects with timestamps

**Ongoing (Reddit API):**

- Call Reddit API for recent content
- Fetch complete posts and comment threads
- Store post/comment IDs for direct access
- Optimize API usage through batching

2. **Content Processing**

- Parse and structure the retrieved content
- Send to LLM for entity and relationship extraction
- Extract sentiment and context information
- Connect to Google Places API for restaurant entities

3. **Knowledge Graph Updates**

- Create new entities, connections, and mentions as discovered
- When processing content, the system will **create or update ANY connections between entities that are mentioned**
- Store supporting mentions with metrics
- Update raw connection metrics
- Handle overlapping data between archives and API

4. **Quality Score Updates**

- Recalculate quality scores for affected entities
- Update score timestamps
- Maintain score history for trend analysis

##### Processing Approach

- **Unified Pipeline**: Both data sources use the same entity extraction and processing pipeline
- **Temporal Merging**: Combine archive data with API data based on timestamps
- **Duplicate Detection**: Prevent duplicate processing of overlapping content
- **Complete Context Capture**: All discovered entities and relationships from both sources are stored

#### 5.1.3 On-Demand Query-Driven Collection

##### Purpose

Fill knowledge gaps in real-time when user queries return insufficient data from existing archives and recent Reddit API data.

##### Trigger Conditions

- Query results fall below quality or quantity threshold
- High-interest entities with limited data in knowledge graph
- User explicitly requests more information
- Recent trending topics not captured in scheduled collection

##### Process Flow

1. **Query-Specific Keyword Search**

- Extract entities from user query requiring enrichment
- Search Reddit API using `/r/subreddit/search?q={entity}&sort=relevance&limit=1000`
- Fetch complete posts and comment threads for relevant results
- Focus on most relevant content prioritized by Reddit's algorithm

2. **Rapid Processing**

- Use the same LLM pipeline as other collection methods
- Process only content needed for current query
- Optimize for response speed and user experience

3. **Comprehensive Knowledge Graph Updates**

- **Create or update ANY connections between entities that are mentioned** (not just search targets)
- Organic entity discovery through cross-references in found content
- Update query-relevant entities and connections
- Recalculate quality scores for affected entities
- No additional API calls for newly discovered entities

4. **Result Enhancement**

- Immediately incorporate new data into query results
- Provide user with enhanced recommendations

##### Key Characteristics

- **Keyword search methodology**: Uses same approach as ongoing keyword entity search cycles
- **1000-item limit acceptable**: Quality over quantity for gap-filling, most relevant content prioritized
- **Entity expansion**: Discovers and processes all entities mentioned, not just search targets
- **Comment limitation workaround**: Fetches all comments for relevant posts found via keyword search
- **Real-time optimization**: Balances comprehensive processing with response speed requirements

#### 5.1.4 Knowledge Graph Growth

- **Multi-Source Organic Expansion**:

  - **Historical foundation**: Pushshift archives provide comprehensive baseline entity discovery
  - **Chronological growth**: Regular collection cycles capture new entities and evolving discussions
  - **Targeted enrichment**: Keyword entity search fills historical gaps for priority entities
  - **Query-driven discovery**: On-demand collection uncovers entities through user interest patterns
  - **Cross-entity discovery**: Multi-entity-type keyword searches create comprehensive semantic coverage

- **Bidirectional Connection Strengthening**:
  - **Historical context**: Keyword searches provide deep historical context for recently discovered entities
  - **Real-time validation**: Chronological collection validates and updates historical entity relevance
  - **Attribute-driven discovery**: Restaurant and dish attribute searches uncover indirect entity mentions
  - **Quality evolution**: Connections strengthen through diverse mention sources and cross-validation
  - **Comprehensive coverage**: Full timeline knowledge from archives + real-time updates creates robust entity relationships

### 5.2 Shared Entity Resolution System

To ensure accurate metrics and search functionality, the system employs a multi-phase approach to handle name variations of all entity types: restaurants, dish_or_category, dish_attribute, and restaurant_attribute:

#### 5.2.1 Resolution Process Flow

##### Phase 1: LLM Entity Extraction & Normalization

During data collection, the LLM:

- Extracts raw entity mentions from content
- Normalizes spelling, formatting, and common variations
- Provides both raw text and normalized version

##### Phase 2: Database Entity Resolution w/ Batching (Server-Side)

**Scope-Aware Resolution Process**

**Standard Entity Resolution Process**: The system resolves all entity types through name matching with type constraints. Most entities have unambiguous types and resolve directly (restaurants and dish_or_categories). For context-dependent attributes that can exist in both dish and restaurant contexts (cuisine, dietary, value, etc.), the system creates separate entities based on scope and matches by both **name AND entity type** to ensure accurate targeting.

**Standard entity resolution examples:**

- "Franklin BBQ" ‚Üí Resolves to Franklin BBQ restaurant entity
- "ramen" ‚Üí Resolves to ramen dish_or_category entity

**Context-dependent attribute resolution (special case):**

- "Italian pasta" ‚Üí LLM determines dish context ‚Üí Resolves to Italian dish_attribute entity (ID: 123)
- "Italian restaurant" ‚Üí LLM determines restaurant context ‚Üí Resolves to Italian restaurant_attribute entity (ID: 456)
- "vegan burger" ‚Üí LLM determines dish context ‚Üí Resolves to vegan dish_attribute entity
- "vegan restaurant" ‚Üí LLM determines restaurant context ‚Üí Resolves to vegan restaurant_attribute entity

This enables precise query targeting while maintaining normal operation for all standard entity types.

**Three-Tier Resolution Process**

1. **Exact match against canonical names**: Single query `WHERE name IN (...) AND type = $entity_type`
2. **Alias matching**: Single query with array operations `WHERE aliases && ARRAY[...] AND type = $entity_type`
3. **Fuzzy matching for remaining entities**: Individual queries, edit distance ‚â§ 3-4, with type constraint

##### Phase 3: Batched Processing Pipeline

1. **Batch deduplication**: Consolidate duplicates within batch by normalized name
2. **In-memory ID mapping**: Build `{temp_id ‚Üí db_id}` dictionary from results
3. **Bulk database operations**: Single transaction with UPSERT statements
4. **Prepared statement caching**: Cache query execution plans for all resolution and insertion queries

**Resolution Decision Logic**

- **High confidence (>0.85)**: Merge with existing entity, add original text as alias
- **Medium confidence (0.7-0.85)**: Apply heuristic rules or flag for review
- **Low confidence (<0.7)**: Create new entity

**Alias Management**

- When merging with existing entity, add raw text as new alias if not exists

#### 5.2.2 Entity Resolution Optimization

##### Fuzzy Matching Performance Optimizations

If fuzzy matching becomes a bottleneck, implement these alternatives:

**Efficient Algorithm Alternatives:**

- BK-tree or locality-sensitive hashing for faster string matching
- Use approximate string matching libraries optimized for this use case
- Pre-compute common variations/misspellings for high-frequency entities

**Processing Optimizations:**

- Process fuzzy matching in smaller sub-batches to prevent memory issues
- Set time limits per entity rather than count limits
- Use parallel processing for the fuzzy matching step specifically

**Async Processing Approach:**

- Do exact/alias matching first, create entities for non-matches
- Run fuzzy matching in background and merge duplicates later
- Prioritize system responsiveness over perfect deduplication

##### Performance Monitoring

- **Resolution timing**: Track time by entity type and batch size
- **Fuzzy match efficiency**: Monitor expensive operations
- **Database operation metrics**: Measure insert/update performance
- **Memory usage tracking**: Ensure efficient resource utilization

#### 5.2.3 Query Processing Application

The same entity resolution process applies during user queries, with scope determination only for context-dependent attributes, and key optimizations for real-time performance:

1. LLM normalizes user query entity terms and determines contextual scope for attributes
2. System matches against canonical names and aliases with type constraints (standard for all entities)
3. Query processes using matched entities for database search

**Standard entity resolution examples:**

- User searches: "best food at tatsuyas" ‚Üí "tatsuyas" resolves to "Ramen Tatsu-Ya" restaurant entity
- User searches: "best reuben" ‚Üí "reuben" resolves to reuben dish_or_category entity

**Context-dependent attribute resolution examples:**

- User searches: "crispy chicken" ‚Üí "crispy" resolves to crispy dish_attribute, "chicken" to chicken dish_or_category
- User searches: "restaurants with patio" ‚Üí "patio" resolves to patio restaurant_attribute entity
- User searches: "spicy ramen" ‚Üí "spicy" resolves to spicy dish_attribute, "ramen" to ramen dish_or_category
- User searches: "best Italian food" ‚Üí "Italian" resolves to Italian dish_attribute entity (context-dependent)
- User searches: "Italian restaurants" ‚Üí "Italian" resolves to Italian restaurant_attribute entity (context-dependent)
- User searches: "vegan ramen" ‚Üí "vegan" resolves to vegan dish_attribute, "ramen" to ramen dish_or_category (context-dependent)

##### Key Differences from Data Collection Resolution

**Read-Only Entity Resolution**

- **Never creates new entities** - only matches existing ones
- **No alias additions** - database remains unchanged
- **Unrecognized terms** treated as search filters or ignored

**Speed-Optimized Processing**

- **Cached common mappings** for frequent queries ("tatsuyas" ‚Üí "Ramen Tatsu-Ya")
- **Faster fuzzy matching** with optimized thresholds
- **Real-time constraints** - sub-100ms entity resolution target
- **Parallel processing** of multiple entity types

**Search Expansion Strategy**

- **Lower confidence threshold** (>0.6 vs >0.7) - better to include than miss
- **Multi-entity candidates** - include multiple matches when ambiguous
- **Broader category inclusion** - "ramen" expands to all ramen subtypes
- **Alias propagation** - all aliases included in database queries

**Graceful Degradation**

- **Partial entity matching** - process recognized entities, ignore unrecognized
- **Fallback to broader categories** if specific entities not found
- **Maintain query intent** even with imperfect entity resolution

### 5.3 Quality Score Computation

#### 5.3.1 Dish Quality Score (85-90%)

##### Primary component based on connection strength:

- **Connection strength metrics**:
  - Mention count with time decay
  - Total upvotes with time decay
  - Source diversity (unique discussion threads)

##### Secondary component (10-15%):

- **Restaurant context factor**: Derived from the parent restaurant's quality score
  - Provides a small boost to dishes from generally excellent restaurants
  - Serves as effective tiebreaker

#### 5.3.2 Restaurant Quality Score (80% + 20%)

##### Primary component (80%):

- **Top dish connections**: 3-5 highest-scoring dishes at restaurant
  - Captures standout offerings that define restaurant

##### Secondary component (20%):

- **Overall menu consistency**: Average quality across all mentioned dishes
  - Rewards restaurants with strong overall performance

#### 5.3.3 Category/Attribute Performance Score

For restaurant ranking in category/attribute queries:

- **Find relevant dishes**: All restaurant's dishes in queried category or with attribute
- **Contextual score**: Calculate weighted average of dish quality scores for those relevant dishes
- **Replace restaurant score**: Use contextual score instead of restaurant quality score for relevance

## 6. Reddit Data Collection Process

**‚úÖ HYBRID APPROACH CONFIRMED**: This section covers the hybrid Pushshift archives + Reddit API approach, addressing 1000-item search limitations while maintaining real-time capabilities.

**Data Collection Sources:**

- **Historical Foundation**: Pushshift archives (comprehensive historical data through end-2024)
- **Real-Time Updates**: Reddit API for ongoing collection (post-2024)
- **On-Demand Collection**: Reddit API for query-driven gap filling

**Collection Triggers:**

- **Historical Load**: One-time processing of Pushshift archives
- **Scheduled Collection**: Chronological and keyword entity search with dynamic, offset scheduling
- **On-Demand Collection**: Triggered by insufficient query results (Reddit API only)

### 6.1 Processing Pipeline

```
1. Data Source Selection & Content Scope Definition
2. Content Retrieval:
   2a. Pushshift Archive Processing (stream parse zstd-ndjson files)
   2b. Reddit API Collection (chronological + keyword entity search)
   2c. On-Demand Query Collection (keyword search for missing entities)
3. LLM Content Processing (outputs structured mentions with temp IDs; see llm-content-processing.md)
4. Single Consolidated Processing Phase:
   4a. Entity Resolution (with in-memory ID mapping; see section 5.2)
   4b. Mention Scoring & Activity Calculation (using existing DB data; see section 6.4)
   4c. Component-Based Processing (all 6 components applied in parallel; see section 6.5)
5. Single Bulk Database Transaction (all updates atomically committed)
6. Quality Score Updates (triggered by new connection data)
```

**Step 1 and 2**: Data Source Selection & Content Retrieval

**Historical Archives (Pushshift):**

- Download and decompress zstd files from torrent
- Stream parse ndjson line-by-line to handle large files
- Extract post/comment objects with full historical context
- No entity selection needed - process all content linearly

**Reddit API Ongoing Collection:**

- **Chronological Collection**: Fetch all recent posts from target subreddits using dynamic scheduling
- **Keyword Entity Search**: Select high-priority entities using priority scoring algorithm, search for historical content
- Rate limiting and cost optimization across both collection types

**On-Demand Collection:**

- Extract entities from user query requiring enrichment
- Keyword search Reddit API for specific missing entities
- Fetch complete posts and comment threads with URLs

**Step 3**: LLM Content Processing (see llm-content-processing.md for more details)

- Input: Reddit posts/comments
- Output: Structured mentions with temp IDs (only JSON structure needed)
- Processing: Entity extraction, normalization, sentiment filtering

**Step 4**: Consolidated Processing Phase (All-in-One)
4a. Entity Resolution: Three-tier matching with in-memory ID mapping
4b. Mention Scoring: Time-weighted scoring with activity level calculation
4c. Component Processing: 6 parallel components handle all entity combinations

**Step 5**: Single Bulk Database Transaction

- Atomic commit of all entities, connections, mentions, and metrics
- Leverages connection pooling and prepared statements

**Step 6**: Quality Score Updates

- Triggered by new connection data from Step 4
- Pre-computed scores for fast query performance

### 6.2 LLM Processing & Entity Extraction

**Primary Function:** Convert Reddit content into structured mentions with normalized entities

**Key Processing Rules** (see `llm-content-processing.md` for full details):

- **Entity Extraction**: All 4 entity types (restaurant, dish_or_category, dish_attribute, restaurant_attribute)
- **Scope Determination**: Context-dependent attributes assigned to correct scope (dish vs restaurant)
- **Sentiment Filtering**: Only positive mentions processed
- **Category Hierarchy**: Create specific ‚Üí general food categories naturally
- **Entity Normalization**: Handle variations, standardize references

**Output Structure:** Structured mentions with temp IDs (only JSON structure needed in entire pipeline)

### 6.3 LLM Data Collection Input/Output Structures

See llm-content-processing.md for more implementation and processing details.

#### 6.3.1 LLM Input Structure

_**Note**: Based on real Reddit API field analysis (NYC subreddit sample). Uses exact Reddit field names for consistency with source data. Key principles are batch processing efficiency, original context preservation, and hierarchical post-comment relationships._

```json
{
  "posts": [
    {
      "id": "string",
      "title": "string", 
      "selftext": "string",
      "subreddit": "string",
      "author": "string",
      "permalink": "string",
      "score": number,

      "comments": [
        {
          "id": "string",
          "body": "string",
          "author": "string",
          "score": number,
          "parent_id": "string",
          "permalink": "string",
          "subreddit": "string",
          "created_utc": number
        },
        ...
      ]
    }
  ],
  "comments": [
    {
      "id": "string",
      "body": "string", 
      "author": "string",
      "score": number,
      "parent_id": "string|null",
      "permalink": "string",
      "subreddit": "string",
      "created_utc": number
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

**Field Descriptions:**
- **`id`**: Reddit ID with type prefix (e.g., `"t3_1mg7vy4"`, `"t1_n6mnqad"`) for type safety
- **`title`**: Post title text
- **`selftext`**: Post body text content (Reddit field name) 
- **`body`**: Comment text content (Reddit field name)
- **`author`**: Reddit username
- **`subreddit`**: Subreddit name without "r/" prefix
- **`parent_id`**: Parent object ID with type prefix (`"t3_postid"` for top-level comments, `"t1_commentid"` for replies)
- **`permalink`**: Reddit URL path for source attribution
- **`score`**: Net votes (upvotes minus downvotes)
- **`created_utc`**: Unix timestamp (Reddit field name)
- **`comments`**: Array for standalone comments from archive-only processing

**Minimal Field Set:** Optimized for food discovery use case, removing unnecessary metadata like editing timestamps, vote ratios, and moderation flags.

#### 6.3.2 LLM Output Structure

_**Note**: Structure will evolve during implementation. Key principles are entity normalization with original text preservation, attribute classification for processing guidance, and source traceability._

```json
{
  "mentions": [
    {
      "temp_id": "string",
      "restaurant": {
        "normalized_name": "string" | null,
        "original_text": "string" | null,
        "temp_id": "string"
      },
      "restaurant_attributes": ["string"] | null,
      "dish_or_category": {
        "normalized_name": "string" | null,
        "original_text": "string" | null,
        "temp_id": "string"
      } | null,
      "dish_attributes": [
        {
          "attribute": ["string"] | null,
          "type": "selective|descriptive"
        },
      ] | null,
      "is_menu_item": boolean,
      "general_praise": boolean,
      "source": {
        "type": "post|comment",
        "id": "string",
        "url": "string",
        "upvotes": number,
        "created_at": "timestamp"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### 6.4 Consolidated Processing Phase

The system uses a **single consolidated processing phase** (step 4 above) that eliminates intermediate JSON structures and performs all operations within one efficient database transaction.

**Phase Input:** LLM output structure (the only JSON structure needed)
**Phase Output:** Direct database updates (no intermediate JSON required)

**Key Benefits:**

- **Single database transaction** ensures atomicity and performance
- **In-memory processing** eliminates serialization overhead
- **Batch operations** optimize database performance
- **Simplified error handling** - single phase to retry if needed

Within the single consolidated processing phase, the system performs:

#### 6.4.1 Entity Resolution (step 4a):

_**Note**: see section 5.2 for detailed implementation_

- **Three-tier resolution process**: Entity matching using exact, alias, and fuzzy matching
- **In-memory ID mapping**: Build `{temp_id ‚Üí db_id}` dictionary from resolution results
- **Batched processing**: All resolution operations performed in batches for optimal performance

#### 6.4.2 Mention Scoring & Activity Calculation (step 4b):

**Purpose**: Calculate time-weighted mention scores and activity levels to support the attribution system and user experience strategy outlined in section 8.2.

**‚úÖ HYBRID DATA SUPPORT**: Activity level calculations leverage real-time Reddit API data for current trends while historical Pushshift data provides comprehensive context for quality scoring.

##### Top Mention Scoring and Management

###### Process Overview

- **Update trigger**: Recalculated each time new mentions are processed
- **Re-scoring process**: Re-score ALL existing top mentions using time-weighted formula: `upvotes √ó e^(-days_since / 60)`
- **New mention scoring**: Score new mentions with same formula
- **Top mention selection**: Compare all scores and update top 3-5 mentions array
- **Continuous decay**: This approach ensures recent mentions naturally rise to top over time

###### Attribution Integration

- **Purpose**: Top mention is used for attribution display (see section 8.2)
- **Storage format**: Top mentions stored in `connections.top_mentions` JSONB array with mention metadata: `{"mention_id": "uuid", "score": 45.2, "upvotes": 67, ...}`

##### Activity Level Calculation and Management

###### Timestamp Tracking

- **Process**: For each new mention, compare mention timestamp against current `last_mentioned_at` value
- **Update logic**: Update connection metadata if newer mention timestamp found
- **Usage**: This timestamp drives activity level calculations and user experience features

###### Activity Level Determination

- **"trending" (üî•)**: All top 3-5 mentions are within 30 days
- **"active" (üïê)**: `last_mentioned_at` is within 7 days
- **"normal"**: Default state - no activity indicator displayed
- **Real-time relevance**: Activity indicators provide immediate signals to users about community engagement (see section 8.2)

###### Implementation Details

- **Calculation timing**: Activity level determined during this mention processing phase
- **Data dependency**: Uses existing `last_mentioned_at` and `top_mentions` data
- **Database storage**: Activity level stored in `connections.activity_level` enum field
- **Update frequency**: Recalculated when new mentions processed
- **UI integration**: Simple conditional display based on stored activity_level enum
- **Performance**: No additional API calls or real-time calculations required

#### 6.4.3 Component-Based Processing (step 4c):

_**Note**: see section 6.5 below for component details_

- All 6 processing components execute in parallel using resolved entity IDs
- Results accumulated in memory for single transaction

### 6.5 Component-Based DB Processing Guide

#### 6.5.1 Modular Processing Components

The system processes LLM output through independent components. All applicable components process independently for each mention.

**Component 1: Restaurant Entity Processing**

- Always Processed
- Action: Create restaurant entity if missing from database

**Component 2: Restaurant Attributes Processing**

- Processed when: restaurant_attributes is present
- Action: Add restaurant_attribute entity IDs to restaurant entity's metadata if not already present

**Component 3: General Praise Processing**

- Processed when: general_praise is true (mentions containing holistic restaurant praise)
- Action: Boost all existing dish connections for this restaurant
- Note: Do not create dish connections if none exist

**Component 4: Specific Dish Processing**

- Processed when: dish_or_category is present AND is_menu_item is true

With Dish Attributes:

- **All Selective:** Find existing restaurant‚Üídish connections for the same dish that have ANY of the selective attributes; If found: boost those connections; If not found: create new connection with all attributes
- **All Descriptive:** Find ANY existing restaurant‚Üídish connections for the same dish; If found: boost connections + add descriptive attributes if not already present; If not found: create new connection with all attributes
- **Mixed:** Find existing connections for the same dish that have ANY of the selective attributes; If found: boost + add descriptive attributes if not already present; If not found: create new connection with all attributes

Without Dish Attributes:

- Action: Find/create restaurant‚Üídish connection and boost it

**Component 5: Category Processing**

- Processed when: dish_or_category is present AND is_menu_item is false

With Dish Attributes:

- **All Selective:** Find existing dish connections with category; Filter to connections with ANY of the selective attributes; Boost filtered connections; Do not create if no matches found
- **All Descriptive:** Find existing dish connections with category; Boost all found connections; Add descriptive attributes to those connections if not already present; Do not create if no category dishes exist
- **Mixed:** Find existing dish connections with category; Filter to connections with ANY of the selective attributes; Boost filtered connections + add descriptive attributes if not already present; Do not create if no matches found

Without Dish Attributes:

- Action: Find existing dish connections with category and boost them
- Do not create if no category dishes exist

**Component 6: Attribute-Only Processing**

- Processed when: dish_or_category is null AND dish_attributes is present

- **All Selective:** Find existing dish connections with ANY of the selective attributes; Boost those connections; Do not create if no matches found
- **All Descriptive:** Skip processing (no target for descriptive attributes)
- **Mixed:** Find existing dish connections with ANY of the selective attributes; Boost those connections; Ignore descriptive attributes

#### 6.5.2 Entity Creation Rules

**Always Create:**

- Restaurant entities: When restaurant is missing from database
- Specific dish connections: When is_menu_item: true and no matching connection exists

**Never Create (Skip Processing):**

- Category dishes: When category mentioned but no dishes with that category exist
- Attribute matches: When attribute filtering finds no existing dishes
- General praise dish connections: When general_praise: true but no dish connections exist
- Descriptive-only attributes: When no dish_or_category is present

#### 6.5.3 Attribute Processing Logic

**Selective Attributes (OR Logic):**
When finding existing connections with selective attributes, use OR logic (match ANY of the selective attributes):

- "great vegan and gluten-free options" ‚Üí Boost dishes that are vegan OR gluten-free
- "spicy reuben is amazing" ‚Üí Find reuben connections that have spicy OR any other selective attributes

**Descriptive Attributes (AND Logic):**
When adding descriptive attributes to connections, ALL descriptive attributes are added together:

- "this pasta is very creamy and rich" ‚Üí Add both "creamy" AND "rich" to the pasta connection
- Descriptive attributes characterize the specific item, so they all apply simultaneously

**Why This Logic:**

- Selective attributes represent filtering criteria - users want options that satisfy any of their dietary/preference needs
- Descriptive attributes describe specific characteristics of individual items - they all describe the same dish
- OR logic for selective maximizes relevant results; AND logic for descriptive ensures complete characterization

#### 6.5.4 Core Principles

1. **Modular Processing:** All applicable components process independently
2. **Additive Logic:** Multiple processing components can apply to the same mention
3. **Selective = Filtering:** Find existing connections that match any of the selective attributes
4. **Descriptive = Enhancement:** Add attributes to existing connections if not already present
5. **OR Logic:** Multiple selective attributes use OR logic (any match qualifies)
6. **Create Specific Only:** Only create new connections for specific dishes (menu items)
7. **No Placeholder Creation:** Never create category dishes or attribute matches that don't exist
8. **Restaurant Always Created:** Restaurant entities are always created if missing

### 6.6 Database Operations, Metrics, and Performance Optimizations

#### 6.6.1 Foundation Infrastructure

**Database Connection Management:**

- **Connection pooling**: Establish database connection pool at application startup
- **Prepared statements**: Cache query execution plans for all resolution and insertion queries
- **Core indexes**: Pre-existing indexes on entity names, aliases, and normalized fields for optimal performance

#### 6.6.2 Bulk Database Operations

**Transaction Strategy:**

- **Single atomic transaction**: All updates committed together for consistency and performance
- **UPSERT operations**: `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE/NOTHING` for efficient entity merging
- **Bulk operations**: Multi-row inserts/updates minimize database round trips (biggest performance gain)

**Operation Sequence:**

1. **Entity resolution results** ‚Üí Update existing entities, create new entities, update aliases, add restaurant attributes to metadata, etc.
2. **Connection updates** ‚Üí Modify metrics, attributes, categories, activity levels, and other metadata
3. **Top mention updates** ‚Üí Replace top mention arrays with newly ranked mentions

#### 6.6.3 Metric Aggregation

**Connection Metrics Aggregation:**

Raw metrics calculated and accumulated with each connection during processing:

- **Mention count**: Total number of mentions for this connection
- **Total upvotes**: Sum of upvotes across all mentions
- **Source diversity**: Count of unique threads/discussions mentioning this connection
- **Recent mention count**: Mentions within last 30 days
- **Last mentioned timestamp**: Most recent mention date for activity calculations

**Metrics Usage:**

- **Evidence display**: Support user-facing evidence cards and attribution
- **Quality score computation**: Feed into global ranking algorithms
- **Query filtering**: Enable attribute-based filtering thresholds

#### 6.6.4 Performance Monitoring and Optimization

**Key Performance Metrics:**

- **Resolution timing**: Track entity resolution time by type and batch size
- **Database operation timing**: Measure insert/update performance across operation types
- **Batch processing efficiency**: Monitor processing time vs. batch size relationships
- **Memory usage tracking**: Ensure efficient resource utilization during bulk operations
- **Fuzzy matching efficiency**: Identify expensive operations for optimization

**Implementation Strategy:**

**Phase 1: Foundation (Start Here)**

- Straightforward sequential processing with robust error handling
- Simple batch size tuning (start with 100-500 entities per batch)
- Basic instrumentation to measure bottlenecks and identify optimization opportunities
- Focus on getting fundamentals right before advanced optimizations

**Phase 2: Measured Improvements (Only After Testing)**

- Simple LRU cache for frequently accessed entities (track cache hit rates)
- Basic parallelization by entity type based on measured bottlenecks
- Batch size optimization based on actual performance data
- Query optimization based on real usage patterns

**Phase 3: Scale-Driven Optimizations (Only If Needed)**

- Redis caching for high-frequency entity lookups
- Worker pools for parallel processing
- Bloom filters for efficient duplicate detection
- Temporary tables for very large batch processing

## 7. Query Processing System

### 7.1 Query Processing Pipeline (occurs when queries return sufficient data)

```
1. User Query Input
2. Cache Check (Hot Query Cache - 1 hour)
3. LLM Entity Extraction and Analysis (see llm_query_processing.md for processing rules)
4. Entity Normalization and Resolution
5. Dynamic Query Building Based on Extracted Entities
6. Graph Database Query Execution and Result Ranking
  6.1 If insufficient data is returned, trigger on-demand data collection (see section 5 for details)
7. Return Format Determination Based on Entity Composition
8. Cache Storage
9. Response Delivery
```

### 7.2 Multi-Level Caching Strategy

#### 7.2.1 Cache Implementation Levels

##### Hot Query Cache (1 hour retention)

**Purpose:** Handle high-frequency and trending searches
**Example:** "best ramen downtown"

- First query: Process and cache results
- Same query within hour: Instant results
- **Benefits:** Handles viral/trending searches efficiently

##### Recent Search Results (24 hour retention)

**Purpose:** Optimize follow-up searches with complete result sets
**Example:** User searches "best tacos", comes back later

- Store complete result sets with quality scores and evidence
- Update if significant new data becomes available

##### Static Data Cache (7+ days retention)

**Purpose:** Reduce database load for common data
**Examples:** Restaurant basic info, entity metadata, common patterns

#### 7.2.2 Cache Invalidation Strategy

- **Time-based expiration** for different data types based on volatility
- **Smart invalidation** when entities receive new mentions or updates
- **Trend-based cache warming** for predicted popular queries
- **Geographic cache segmentation** for location-based query optimization

#### 7.2.3 Redis Implementation

- **Connection pooling** established at application startup
- **Efficient serialization** for complex result sets
- **LRU eviction** with appropriate memory limits
- **Performance monitoring** of hit rates and response times

### 7.3 Query Understanding & Processing via LLM Analysis

#### 7.3.1 Entity-Based Query Processing

The system processes queries through LLM analysis (see llm_query_processing.md) to extract **all relevant mentioned entities**, which are then used to dynamically build optimal database queries that **adapt to the entity combination provided**. The extracted entities determine both the query structure and the return format.

**Entity Types Processed:**

- **restaurants**: Physical dining establishments referenced by name
- **dish_or_category**: Specific dishes or food categories mentioned
- **dish_attributes**: Connection-scoped descriptors (spicy, vegan, house-made, crispy)
- **restaurant_attributes**: Restaurant-scoped descriptors (patio, romantic, family-friendly, authentic)

##### Examples of Entity-Driven Query Processing:

- **"best ramen"** ‚Üí dish_or_category: ["ramen"] ‚Üí Find all ramen connections, return dual lists
- **"best dishes at Franklin BBQ"** ‚Üí restaurant: ["Franklin BBQ"] ‚Üí Find all connections for this restaurant, return single list
- **"best spicy ramen with patio"** ‚Üí dish_or_category: ["ramen"], dish_attributes: ["spicy"], restaurant_attributes: ["patio"] ‚Üí Filter connections by all criteria, return dual lists
- **"best vegan restaurants"** ‚Üí restaurant_attributes: ["vegan"] ‚Üí Find restaurants with vegan attribute, return dual lists
- **"best Italian food at romantic restaurants"** ‚Üí dish_attributes: ["Italian"], restaurant_attributes: ["romantic"] ‚Üí Combine filters, return dual lists

#### 7.3.2 Query Analysis & Processing

##### Primary Function: Convert natural language queries to structured entity parameters for dynamic query building

_Important: This process maps queries to existing entities and relationships for graph traversal._

Simplified Processing Tasks (see llm_query_processing.md for more details):

- **Entity extraction**: Extract all relevant entities (restaurants, dish_or_category, dish_attribute, restaurant_attribute)
- **Term normalization and entity resolution**: Handle entity variations and standardize references
- **Attribute scope classification**: Distinguish between dish-scoped and restaurant-scoped attributes
- **Location and availability requirements**: Identify geographic and temporal constraints
- **Output standardized format**: Structure extracted entities for dynamic query building

### 7.4 LLM Query Processing Input/Output Structures

See llm_query_processing.md for more implementation and processing details.

#### 7.4.1 LLM Input Structure

_**Note**: Structure may evolve during implementation. Key principles are query context preservation, geographic constraint integration, and user preference continuity._

```json
{
  "query": "string",
  "location_bounds": {
    "ne_lat": number,
    "ne_lng": number,
    "sw_lat": number,
    "sw_lng": number
  },
  "open_now": boolean,
  "user_context": "string|null"
}
```

#### 7.4.2 LLM Output Structure

_**Note**: Structure may evolve during implementation. The key principles are entity organization by type with preserved original text and resolved database identifiers._

```json
{
  "entities": {
    "restaurants": [
      {
        "normalized_name": "string",
        "original_text": "string" | null, // original user text
        "entity_ids": ["uuid"] // resolved database IDs
      }
    ],
    "dish_or_categories": [
      {
        "normalized_name": "string",
        "original_text": "string" | null,
        "entity_ids": ["uuid"]
      }
    ],
    "dish_attributes": [
      {
        "normalized_name": "string",
        "original_text": "string" | null,
        "entity_id": "uuid"
      }
    ],
    "restaurant_attributes": [
      {
        "normalized_name": "string",
        "original_text": "string" | null,
        "entity_id": "uuid"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### 7.5 Dynamic Query Architecture

#### 7.5.1 Entity-Driven Query System Design

The system uses a **single dynamic query builder** that adapts its SQL structure based on the entities extracted from user queries. This approach eliminates the need for multiple specialized query patterns while maintaining optimal performance.

**Core Architecture Principles:**

- **Entity-Based Logic**: Query structure determined entirely by which entities are present
- **Adaptive Filtering**: Dynamic WHERE clauses based on entity types and scopes
- **Performance Optimization**: Single query pattern optimized for all entity combinations
- **Scope-Aware Processing**: Automatic handling of restaurant-scoped vs connection-scoped attributes

**Query Building Flexibility:**

- **Multiple entities of same type**: Natural OR logic handling (`WHERE dish_or_category_id = ANY($entity_ids)`)
- **Mixed entity types**: Combines filters across entity scopes seamlessly
- **Attribute scope processing**: Automatic tier-based filtering for dish_attributes vs restaurant_attributes
- **Missing entities**: Graceful handling when certain entity types are not provided

#### 7.5.2 Dynamic Query Building Logic

The system constructs adaptive database queries through a multi-stage filtering approach that responds to entity presence. The query architecture uses conditional logic blocks that activate only when corresponding entities are detected, creating an efficient and flexible query execution pattern.

##### Multi-Stage Filtering Approach:

- Conditional logic blocks activate based on entity presence
- Efficient execution pattern adapts to any entity combination
- Performance optimized through early dataset reduction

**Stage 1: Restaurant Filtering**

- **Direct entity matching**: When specific restaurants mentioned ‚Üí filter to those venues
- **Restaurant attributes**: Array intersection for attributes like "patio" or "romantic"
- **Geographic bounds**: Spatial operations using map viewport coordinates
- **Availability**: Operating hours metadata + "open now" toggle evaluation

**Stage 2: Connection Filtering**

- **dish_or_category matching**: Array operations for specific dishes/categories mentioned
- **Dish attributes**: Array intersection for connection-scoped attributes ("spicy", "vegan")
- **Applied to**: Eligible restaurant set from Stage 1

**Adaptive Execution Logic:**

- **Entity present** ‚Üí Corresponding filter activates
- **Entity absent** ‚Üí Filter becomes null check (disabled)
- **Performance benefit**: Avoids unnecessary operations
- **Flexibility**: Handles any entity combination naturally

**Result Processing:**

- **Ranking**: Leverages pre-computed `dish_quality_score` or `restaurant_quality_score` values, ranked in descending order in real-time

#### 7.5.3 Attribute Scope Processing

The system automatically applies the correct filtering logic based on attribute scope:

**Restaurant-Scoped Filtering (restaurant_attributes)**

- Applied to restaurants table in the `filtered_restaurants` CTE
- Affects which restaurants are considered for the entire query
- Filter: `WHERE restaurant_attributes && ARRAY[attribute_ids]`
- Examples: patio, romantic, family-friendly, authentic

**Connection-Scoped Filtering (dish_attributes)**

- Applied to connections table in the `filtered_connections` CTE
- Affects which dish-restaurant pairs are returned
- Filter: `WHERE dish_attributes && ARRAY[attribute_ids]`
- Examples: spicy, vegan, house-made, crispy

#### 7.5.4 Query Building Process

Following **step 5** in the query pipeline, the system:

1. **Entity Analysis**: Examine which entity types are present in the processed query
2. **Dynamic SQL Construction**: Build conditional WHERE clauses based on entity presence
3. **Parameter Binding**: Inject resolved entity IDs and filter values into query
4. **Scope-Aware Filtering**: Apply restaurant attributes before connection filtering for optimal performance
5. **Geographic Integration**: Include map boundaries and availability filters
6. **Query Optimization**: Leverage database indexes and pre-computed scores for fast execution

#### 7.5.5 Query Execution Examples

**Query: "best spicy ramen with patio seating"**

- **Entities extracted**: dish_or_category ("ramen") + dish_attribute ("spicy") + restaurant_attribute ("patio")
- **Processing order**:
  1. Filter restaurants with "patio" attribute
  2. Find ramen connections at those restaurants
  3. Filter connections with "spicy" attribute
- **Result**: Dual lists of spicy ramen dishes at restaurants with patios

**Query: "best dishes at Franklin BBQ"**

- **Entities extracted**: restaurant ("Franklin BBQ") only
- **Processing order**:
  1. Filter to Franklin BBQ specifically
  2. Retrieve all connections for that restaurant
  3. No additional dish/attribute filtering
- **Result**: Single list of all Franklin's menu items (restaurant context known)

**Query: "best vegan Italian food"**

- **Entities extracted**: dish_or_category ("Italian") + dish_attribute ("vegan")
- **Processing order**:
  1. No restaurant-level filtering (all eligible)
  2. Filter connections for Italian food AND vegan attribute
  3. Array intersection logic for both criteria
- **Result**: Dual lists ‚Üí vegan Italian dishes + restaurants excelling in this combo

**Processing Adaptation Logic:**

- **Multiple entity types** ‚Üí Apply in order: restaurant filters first, then connection filters
- **Missing entity types** ‚Üí Corresponding filter stages remain dormant
- **Performance benefit** ‚Üí Early dataset reduction through restaurant-scoped filtering
- **Flexibility** ‚Üí No predefined query categories, pure entity-driven logic

#### 7.5.6 Performance Optimizations

**Single Query Pattern Benefits:**

- **Database optimization**: Query planner optimizes one consistent pattern instead of multiple specialized queries
- **Index utilization**: Consistent query structure leverages database indexes effectively
- **Execution plan caching**: Single query pattern enables better plan reuse
- **Filter ordering**: Restaurant-scoped filters applied first to minimize dataset size before connection filtering

**Query Performance Features:**

- **Pre-computed rankings**: Leverages stored `dish_quality_score` and `restaurant_quality_score` fields
- **Geographic index usage**: ST_Contains operations use spatial indexes for fast location filtering
- **Conditional execution**: NULL checks prevent unnecessary filtering when entities not present
- **Bulk parameter binding**: Array parameters enable efficient OR logic for multiple entities

### 7.6 Location & Availability Filtering

Enabled by Google Maps/Places API integration and attribute-based filtering

#### 7.6.1 Map-Based Location Filtering

- **Map-Centric UI**: Users navigate a map interface to define their area of interest
- **Implicit Boundary Filtering**: Query uses visible map boundaries as location filter
- **Implementation**:
  - Each query includes viewport coordinates (NE and SW bounds)
  - Applied during **Dynamic Query Building** (step 5) and executed in **Graph Database Query Execution** (step 6)
  - Database filters restaurants within these coordinates **before ranking** using geographic indexes
  - No text-based location parsing required - eliminates ambiguity in location interpretation

#### 7.6.2 Availability Filtering: Toggle + Attribute Approach

- **"Open Now" Toggle**: Binary filter using current time against stored operating hours
  - Applied during **Dynamic Query Building** with current timestamp
  - Executed in database query **before ranking** for performance optimization
  - Uses structured operating hours data from Google Places API
- **Attribute-based Time Filtering**: System finds restaurants with connections to time/occasion attribute entities
  - Examples: "brunch", "happy hour", "late night", "weekend specials"
  - Processed as dish_attribute or restaurant_attribute entities through natural language
  - Applied using existing dynamic query filtering

### 7.7 Return Format Determination

#### 7.7.1 Entity-Based Return Strategy

The system determines return format based on the **entity composition** of the query rather than predefined query types. This approach provides consistent, predictable responses while adapting to user intent naturally.

#### 7.7.2 Return Format Logic

##### Format Determination Process:

- Analyze entity composition ‚Üí determine user intent ‚Üí select response format
- **Deterministic logic**: No scoring or probability, just entity presence patterns
- **Predictable experience**: Same entity combination = same format

**Single List Criteria:**

```
IF restaurants.length > 0
AND dish_or_categories.length = 0
AND dish_attributes.length = 0
AND restaurant_attributes.length = 0
‚Üí RETURN single_list
```

**Single List Reasoning:**

- User already knows the restaurant
- Intent = menu discovery within that establishment
- Examples: "best dishes at Franklin BBQ", "menu at Tatsu-Ya"

**Dual List Default:**

- **All other entity combinations** ‚Üí dual_list format
- **Philosophy**: Users benefit from both specific items + venue discovery
- **Includes**: dish_or_category only, attributes only, mixed combinations

**Restaurant + Other Entities:**

- **Interpretation**: Restaurant as filter constraint, not venue focus
- **Example**: "best ramen at patio restaurants" ‚Üí dual list (not venue-specific)
- **Maintains discovery value**: Shows both items + venues

**Implementation Benefits:**

- **Consistent UI**: Frontend handles predictable format patterns
- **Clear logic**: Boolean evaluation, no complex decision trees
- **User-intuitive**: Format matches natural query interpretation

#### 7.7.3 Return Format Types

**Single List Returns**

- **Criteria**: Specific restaurants mentioned without dish or attribute context
- **Content**: dish_or_category list scoped to the specified restaurant(s)
- **Rationale**: Users already know the restaurant, want to discover menu items
- **Examples**:
  - "best dishes at Franklin BBQ" ‚Üí Franklin's top dishes
  - "menu at Ramen Tatsu-Ya" ‚Üí Tatsu-Ya's dish list

**Dual List Returns**

- **Criteria**: All other entity combinations
- **Content**: Both dish_or_category list and restaurant list with contextual rankings
- **Rationale**: Users benefit from seeing both specific options and venue recommendations
- **Examples**:
  - "best ramen" ‚Üí Top ramen dishes + restaurants known for ramen
  - "best spicy food with patio" ‚Üí Spicy dishes + restaurants with patios serving great spicy food
  - "best vegan restaurants" ‚Üí Top vegan dishes + restaurants ranked by vegan offerings

#### 7.7.4 Restaurant Ranking Methodology

For dual list returns, restaurant rankings are **contextually calculated** based on query entities:

- **Aggregated performance scoring**: Restaurant rankings based on weighted average of relevant dish_or_category quality scores
- **Entity-specific relevance**: Only dish_or_category items matching the query entities contribute to restaurant ranking
- **Attribute-driven scoring**: Restaurant performance calculated from connections that match specified attributes
- **Recency weighting**: Recent performance weighted more heavily than historical data

#### 7.7.5 Implementation Benefits

- **Predictable UI patterns**: Frontend handles consistent return format logic
- **Entity-driven relevance**: Restaurant rankings always contextual to query entities
- **Natural user flow**: Users get both specific recommendations and venue discovery
- **Performance consistency**: Single query generates both lists simultaneously

#### 7.7.6 Result Structure Consistency

Each result format maintains consistent data structure for seamless UI integration:

- Dish results always include restaurant context and performance metrics
- Restaurant results always include relevant dish examples and performance metrics
- Evidence attribution present across all result types

### 7.8 Post-Processing Result Structure

_**Note**: Structure will evolve during implementation. Key principles are format adaptation, comprehensive evidence, and cross-reference integrity._

### 7.9 Ranking System

_Important: This system relies on pre-computed global quality scores for ranking with attributes serving as filters._

#### 7.9.1 Query Time Ranking

##### Core Ranking Philosophy

The system uses **pre-computed global quality scores** for all ranking decisions, with attributes serving as **filters** rather than ranking modifiers. This approach ensures consistent, fast query performance while maintaining ranking quality.

**Key Principles:**

- **Pre-computed scores drive ranking**: All `dish_quality_score` and `restaurant_quality_score` values calculated during data processing
- **Attributes filter, don't rank**: dish_attributes and restaurant_attributes reduce result sets but don't modify scores
- **Contextual restaurant scoring**: Restaurant rankings calculated from relevant dish performance, not global restaurant scores
- **Activity indicators enhance relevance**: trending/active status provides recency signals without affecting core ranking

##### Ranking Application Logic

**Single List Queries (Restaurant-Specific)**

- **Primary ranking**: `dish_quality_score DESC` for all connections at the specified restaurant
- **No attribute ranking**: Attributes filter eligible dishes but don't modify their pre-computed scores
- **Result**: Restaurant's top dishes ordered by their individual quality scores

**Dual List Queries (Discovery Format)**

**Dish Rankings:**

- **Primary ranking**: `dish_quality_score DESC` across all eligible connections
- **Attribute filtering**: dish_attributes reduce eligible connections before ranking
- **Geographic filtering**: Applied before ranking to eligible restaurant set
- **Result**: Top dishes globally, filtered by query criteria

**Restaurant Rankings:**

- **Contextual performance calculation**: Weighted average of `dish_quality_score` values for dishes matching query entities
- **Entity-specific relevance**: Only dishes matching dish_or_category or dish_attributes contribute to restaurant ranking
- **No global restaurant score**: Restaurant rankings always contextual to query content
- **Result**: Restaurants ranked by their performance in the queried category/attributes

##### Performance Optimizations

**Score Utilization:**

- **Direct database ordering**: `ORDER BY dish_quality_score DESC` leverages database indexes
- **No real-time computation**: All ranking values pre-calculated during data processing
- **Consistent sorting**: Same entity combinations produce identical ranking order
- **Sub-second response**: Ranking logic optimized for < 100ms execution time

**Contextual Restaurant Scoring:**

- **Query-time calculation**: Restaurant scores calculated from eligible dish scores during query execution
- **Attribute-specific performance**: Restaurant ranking reflects query-relevant dish performance only
- **Fallback logic**: Global restaurant score used when no matching dishes exist

##### Ranking Consistency

**Deterministic Results:**

- **Same inputs = same outputs**: Identical queries produce identical rankings
- **Score stability**: Rankings only change when underlying data changes
- **Predictable behavior**: Users see consistent results for repeat queries
- **Cache-friendly**: Stable rankings optimize cache hit rates

**Activity Level Integration:**

- **Visual indicators only**: trending (üî•) and active (üïê) status displayed but don't affect ranking order
- **Relevance signals**: Activity indicators help users identify recently discussed items
- **Score independence**: Activity levels calculated from recency, not incorporated into quality scores
- **User guidance**: Visual cues help users understand community engagement patterns

#### 7.9.2 Results Display

##### List View: Scrollable results with:

- Name of dish-restaurant pair
- Global quality score representation
- Supporting evidence (top mentions, connection metrics)
- Open/closed status
