/**
 * ENTITY IDENTITY KEY (async-integrity step 2, Law 1: identity is content,
 * not delivery). Two names that denote the same real-world thing must
 * contend on the SAME advisory lock and probe the SAME candidate set at
 * creation time — otherwise concurrent batches mint twins that no
 * name-string lock can see (observed: word-order twins "pizza square"/
 * "square pizza" minted 2026-07-31; plural twins before the lemma fix).
 *
 * The key is deliberately COARSE — it exists to serialize creators and
 * widen the adopt probe, not to assert equality. Collisions between
 * genuinely different names ("rice noodle"/"noodle rice"?) cost one lock
 * wait; misses cost a permanent duplicate. Coarse is the right side.
 *
 * Shape per type:
 * - food/ingredient: lemma-collapse the head word to its minimal variant
 *   (min over foodNameVariants — deterministic: both "taco" and "tacos"
 *   variant-sets contain "taco", so both pick it), then SORT the content
 *   tokens so word-order variants converge.
 * - everything else (restaurants, attributes): lowercase, strip
 *   punctuation/possessives ("Phil's" == "Phils"), collapse whitespace.
 *   No token sort — restaurant word order is branding.
