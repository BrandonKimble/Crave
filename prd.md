## 2. Data Architecture

### 2.1 Database Structure

#### Core Tables & Relationships

##### 1. Restaurants

- Basic info (name, location, hours)
- Experience tags
- Digital menu
- Aggregate metrics and stats

##### 2. Dishes

- Name and variations
- Restaurant association
- Category tags
- Dietary tags (maybe)
- Mention metrics and statistics
- Base score

##### 3. Mentions

- Source (post/comment ID)
- Content excerpt
- Thread context/relationships
- Sentiment indicator
- Associated entities (dish/restaurant)
- Upvotes
- Timestamp

_Note: Query-dependent rankings like dish-specific rankings may have to calculated at runtime to be cost effective_

### 2.2 Data Collection

The system uses two distinct collection processes: initial query-driven collection for immediate user needs and background collection for comprehensive data enrichment. Both processes leverage a cheap LLM for entity extraction and relationship analysis.

#### Initial Data Collection (Query-Driven)

Triggered when query results fall below threshold:

##### 1. Query-Specific Search:

- Search Reddit posts and comments for query terms
- Collect full context:
  - Post content
  - All comment threads
  - Parent-child relationships
  - Discussion context

##### 2. Entity Processing:

When new entities (restaurants, dishes) are discovered:

- Create immediate database record with 'pending_enrichment' status
- Include minimal required data for search functionality
- Add basic Google Places data if immediately available

##### 3. AI-Powered Analysis:

- Send structured data to LLM:
  - Combined posts and comments
  - Thread hierarchies
  - Contextual relationships/semantic connections
- LLM extracts:
  - Entities (restaurants, dishes, experience and category tags)
  - Sentiment analysis
  - Entity relationships

##### 4. Scope:

- Process only data from query-related searches
- Store all entities and relationships identified by LLM
- No additional API calls for discovered entities
- Focus on quick result generation
- Mark new entities for priority enrichment in next update cycle

#### Background Data Collection and Freshness (Database-Driven)

##### 1. Entity Processing Cycle

For each tracked entity (restaurant, dish, experience and category tags):

- Prioritize entities marked as 'pending_enrichment'
- Call Reddit search API for posts and comments
- Collect complete discussion contexts
- Send structured data to LLM for analysis
- Update existing entity metrics
- Add newly discovered entities
- Assign standardized experience and category tags

##### 2. Entity Discovery Flow

When new entities are found:

- Immediate database creation with minimal data
- Marked as 'pending_enrichment'
- Prioritized in next update cycle
- Status updates as processing completes
- Regular refresh cycle once 'active'

##### 3. Relationship Processing

- LLM analyzes discussion context to identify:
  - Restaurant-dish associations
  - Experience and category tag assignments
  - Implicit entity connections
  - Sentiment patterns
- System updates:
  - Entity metrics
  - Associations
  - Tags

##### 4. Implementation Strategy

- Weekly processing during off-peak hours
- Update basic info via Google Places API
- Store post/comment IDs for historical access (bypasses Reddit API limitations)
- Optimization techniques:
  - Batch similar API calls
  - Prioritize high-activity entities
  - Cache intermediate results

##### 5. Key Behaviors

- Continuous Enrichment:

  - Update existing entity metrics
  - Add newly discovered entities
  - Refresh entity relationships
  - Update experience and category tags

- Progressive Building:
  - New entities become tracked entities
  - Each cycle builds on previous data
  - Metrics become more comprehensive
  - Relationships grow more detailed

### 2.4 Caching Strategy

#### Cache Levels & Implementation

##### 1. Hot Query Cache (1 hour retention)

Purpose: Handle high-frequency and trending searches

Example: "best ramen downtown"

- First query: Process and cache results
- Same query within hour: Instant results
- Benefits: Handles viral/trending searches efficiently

##### 2. Recent Search Results (24 hour retention)

Purpose: Optimize for follow-up searches

Example: User searches "best tacos", comes back later

- Store complete result sets
- Include ranking context
- Update if significant new data

##### 3. Static Data (7 day retention)

Purpose: Reduce database load for common data

Example: Restaurant basic info, historical trends

- Location/hours data
- Historical rankings
- Tag associations

## 3. External Integration

### 3.1 Reddit API Strategy

#### Implementation Challenges

- 1000 post search limit
- Limited historical data access
- Cost: $0.24/1000 calls
- Rate limit: 100 requests/minute

##### Example Impact:

"best tacos" search might require:

- Initial post search (1 call)
- Comment fetching (multiple calls)
- Historical data access (saved post IDs)
  Total: 5-10 API calls per comprehensive search

#### Solution Strategy

##### 1. Build Historical Access:

- Store all encountered post/comment IDs
- Enable direct content access
- Bypass search limitations

##### 2. Optimize Updates:

- Track last check timestamp
- Only fetch new content
- Batch similar requests

##### 3. Cost Management:

- Aggressive result caching
- Smart update scheduling
- Maintain post ID database

### 3.2 Google Places Integration

##### Primary Functions:

- Basic restaurant information
- Location data/geocoding
- Operating hours
- Order/reservation links

##### Implementation Strategy:

- Limited review access (5 most recent only)
- Focus on core business data
- Consider third-party review data sources
- Optimize API call patterns

## 4. Ranking System

### 4.1 Scoring Architecture

_Important: This system relies entirely on pre-computed scores and simple database queries. No specialized search engines or real-time text analysis are required._

##### Scoring System

- Stored with dish/restaurant records
- Updated periodically in background jobs
- No real-time score computation needed -- Query time only involves:
  - Entity matching
  - Score retrieval
  - Basic filtering

##### Database Ranking Operations

- Fast retrieval of pre-computed scores
- Simple ranking based on stored scores
- Efficient filtering by extracted entities
- Minimal computation at query time

#### Base Score Components

Calculated from Mention frequency, upvotes, Source diversity, and Time relevance (minimal impact)

- Updated with new mentions
- Independent of other dishes
- Reflects community sentiment

##### 2. Restaurant Scoring

Derived from top dish scores

- Updated automatically with dish changes
- Independent of other restaurants

### 4.2 Query-Time Ranking

##### Adapts based on query specificity:

1. Broad Queries

   - Returns: Dishes/Restaurants ranked via base scores
   - Filtered by: Any specified tags
   - Example: "best restaurants" "best food"

2. Category Queries

   - Returns: Dishes with matching tags
   - Ranked by: Base score
   - Example: "best sandwiches"

3. Specific Dish Queries

   - Returns: Matching dishes across restaurants
   - Ranked by: Base score
   - Example: "best pad thai"

4. Venue Queries
   - Returns: Restaurant's dishes
   - Uses: Restaurant menu rankings
   - Example: "what to order at [restaurant]"
