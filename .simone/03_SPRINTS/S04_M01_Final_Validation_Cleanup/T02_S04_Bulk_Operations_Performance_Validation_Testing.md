# Task: Bulk Operations Performance Validation & Testing

## Description

Validate that the existing bulk insert operations in the database layer meet the performance requirements for M01 milestone completion. This involves testing the `createMany` functionality in the BaseRepository, measuring performance characteristics, and ensuring the database can handle bulk operations efficiently as required for future data processing milestones.

## Goal / Objectives

- Validate existing `createMany` method performance in BaseRepository
- Implement comprehensive tests for bulk insert operations across all entity types
- Measure and document baseline performance characteristics for bulk operations
- Ensure database connection pooling supports bulk operations efficiently
- Verify bulk operations work correctly with all entity relationships and constraints

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Bulk insert operations tested for all entity types (entities, connections, mentions)
- [ ] Performance baseline documented for bulk operations (insert rates and memory usage)
- [ ] Tests validate bulk operations with realistic data volumes (100+ records)
- [ ] Error handling verified for bulk operation failures and constraint violations
- [ ] Connection pooling confirmed to handle concurrent bulk operations
- [ ] Integration tests demonstrate bulk operations work with existing schema constraints
- [ ] Performance meets basic requirements for future data processing (no specific targets, just "adequate")

## PRD References

**IMPLEMENTS PRD REQUIREMENTS:**

- Section 4: Data Model & Database Architecture - Bulk operations must work with unified entity model and graph relationships
- Section 2: Technology Stack - Validates Prisma ORM bulk operations performance
- Section 3: Hybrid Monorepo & Modular Monolith Architecture - Ensures repository layer supports bulk data processing
- Section 1: Overview & Core System Architecture - Bulk operations foundational for system scalability
- Section 9 and 9.1: M01 Database Foundation - "Database supports bulk insert operations (performance validation in later milestones)"
- Section 10: POST-MVP Roadmap - Understanding what advanced optimizations to defer
- **Roadmap validation**: Basic bulk operations belong in M01 foundation, advanced optimization in later milestones

**SCOPE BOUNDARIES FROM PRD:**

- **NOT implementing**: M02+ entity processing optimizations (section 9.2+)
- **NOT implementing**: POST-MVP performance monitoring or optimization (section 10.1+)
- **NOT implementing**: Advanced batch processing workflows (future milestones)

## Technical Guidance

**Key interfaces and integration points:**
- `BaseRepository.createMany()` method in `/Users/brandonkimble/crave-search/apps/api/src/repositories/base/base.repository.ts`
- Entity repositories extending BaseRepository pattern
- Prisma ORM integration with PostgreSQL for bulk operations
- PrismaService configuration for connection pooling

**PRD implementation notes:**
- Bulk operations must be validated but not optimized in M01
- Focus on proving the foundation works, detailed optimization comes in later milestones
- Performance validation establishes baseline for future improvements

**Specific imports and module references:**
- `BaseRepository` class and its `createMany` method
- Entity-specific repositories (`EntityRepository`, `ConnectionRepository`)
- Prisma client batch operations and transaction handling
- Jest testing utilities for performance measurement

**Existing patterns to follow:**
- Current repository testing patterns in `*.spec.ts` files
- Error handling patterns in BaseRepository for database operations
- Prisma transaction patterns for data consistency

**Error handling approach:**
- Use existing repository exception handling for bulk operation failures
- Test constraint violation scenarios with bulk data
- Validate proper rollback behavior for failed bulk operations

## Implementation Notes

**Step-by-step implementation approach:**
1. Examine existing `createMany` implementation in BaseRepository
2. Create test data generators for bulk testing scenarios
3. Implement performance tests for bulk inserts across entity types
4. Test bulk operations with foreign key constraints and relationships
5. Measure basic performance characteristics (records per second, memory usage)
6. Validate error handling for bulk operation failures
7. Document baseline performance for future milestone planning

**Key architectural decisions to respect:**
- Use existing BaseRepository pattern without modification
- Work within current Prisma ORM configuration
- Maintain existing error handling and logging structure

**Testing approach:**
- Create integration tests that use realistic data volumes
- Test bulk operations for entities, connections, and mentions tables
- Measure performance with simple timing and memory tracking
- Validate constraint enforcement with bulk data scenarios

**Performance considerations:**
- Focus on proving bulk operations work, not optimizing them
- Establish baseline metrics for future milestone planning
- Ensure current connection pooling configuration supports bulk operations

**MVP Focus:**
- Prove bulk operations meet basic functional requirements
- Establish that database can handle bulk inserts without failures
- Document baseline performance for future optimization work

**Out of Scope:**
- Advanced performance optimization or tuning
- Complex batch processing or transaction management
- Production-level monitoring or metrics collection
- Scaling optimization beyond basic validation

## Subtasks

- [ ] Analyze existing BaseRepository `createMany` implementation
- [ ] Create test data generators for bulk operation testing
- [ ] Implement bulk insert tests for entities table
- [ ] Implement bulk insert tests for connections table with foreign key validation
- [ ] Implement bulk insert tests for mentions table
- [ ] Add performance measurement to bulk operation tests
- [ ] Test error handling scenarios for bulk operation failures
- [ ] Validate connection pooling behavior under bulk operations
- [ ] Document performance baseline and validation results
