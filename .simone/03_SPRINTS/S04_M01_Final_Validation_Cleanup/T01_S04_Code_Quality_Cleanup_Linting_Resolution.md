# Task: Code Quality Cleanup & Linting Resolution

## Description

Systematically resolve all linting errors and TypeScript violations across the repository to ensure code quality meets project standards. This includes fixing unsafe `any` usage, unbound method references, unused variables, and async function issues. The task focuses on maintaining code maintainability and type safety as required by the M01 milestone Definition of Done.

## Goal / Objectives

- Eliminate all linting errors (currently 199+ errors identified across multiple files)
- Fix TypeScript violations including unsafe `any` usage
- Resolve unbound method references and unused variable warnings
- Ensure all async functions properly use await expressions
- Maintain existing functionality while improving code quality

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All ESLint errors are resolved across the repository
- [ ] All TypeScript compiler warnings are addressed
- [ ] No unsafe `any` types remain in production code (test files may use minimal `any` if properly justified)
- [ ] All variables and imports are used or properly removed
- [ ] Async functions contain appropriate await expressions or are converted to sync functions
- [ ] Code passes all existing tests after cleanup
- [ ] Linting command `pnpm --filter api lint` runs without errors or warnings

## PRD References

**IMPLEMENTS PRD REQUIREMENTS:**

- Section 4: Data Model & Database Architecture - Ensures code quality for database layer implementation
- Section 2: Technology Stack - Maintains TypeScript and ESLint standards defined in tech stack
- Section 3: Hybrid Monorepo & Modular Monolith Architecture - Code quality supports architectural patterns
- Section 1: Overview & Core System Architecture - Quality standards for core system reliability
- Section 9 and 9.1: M01 Database Foundation milestone requirements and success criteria
- Section 10: POST-MVP Roadmap - Understanding of what features to avoid implementing
- **Roadmap validation**: Code quality cleanup belongs in M01 foundation milestone per PRD sections 9-10

**SCOPE BOUNDARIES FROM PRD:**

- **NOT implementing**: Features from M02+ milestones (entity processing, LLM integration)
- **NOT implementing**: POST-MVP optimizations or monitoring (section 10.1+)
- **NOT implementing**: Advanced tooling beyond M01 foundation requirements

## Technical Guidance

**Key interfaces and integration points:**
- ESLint configuration in `/Users/brandonkimble/crave-search/apps/api/.eslintrc.js`
- TypeScript configuration in `/Users/brandonkimble/crave-search/apps/api/tsconfig.json`
- Existing error patterns in repository files, service classes, and test files

**PRD implementation notes:**
- Code quality is a foundational requirement for M01 milestone completion
- Clean code base is essential for future milestone development

**Specific imports and module references:**
- Repository classes in `src/repositories/` requiring error handling cleanup
- Service classes with async/await pattern improvements needed
- Test files with TypeScript assertion improvements needed

**Existing patterns to follow:**
- Error handling patterns in `BaseRepository` class
- TypeScript type definitions in shared modules
- Jest testing patterns for proper type assertions

**Error handling approach:**
- Maintain existing error handling structure while fixing type safety
- Use proper TypeScript types instead of `any` where possible
- Follow existing exception handling patterns in repository classes

## Implementation Notes

**Step-by-step implementation approach:**
1. Run full lint analysis to categorize error types
2. Fix unused variable and import issues first (lowest risk)
3. Address unbound method references by converting to arrow functions or proper binding
4. Replace unsafe `any` types with proper TypeScript interfaces
5. Fix async/await patterns in service and repository methods
6. Verify all tests still pass after each category of fixes
7. Run final lint check to ensure all errors are resolved

**Key architectural decisions to respect:**
- Maintain existing repository pattern and interface structure
- Preserve current error handling and logging patterns
- Keep existing service layer architecture intact

**Testing approach:**
- Run existing test suite after each major category of fixes
- Verify repository and service functionality remains intact
- Ensure integration tests continue to pass

**Performance considerations:**
- Code cleanup should not impact runtime performance
- Focus on type safety and maintainability over micro-optimizations

**MVP Focus:**
- Resolve all linting errors to meet M01 DoD requirements
- Maintain existing functionality without adding new features
- Achieve clean, maintainable code base for future development

**Out of Scope:**
- Adding new linting rules or changing ESLint configuration
- Refactoring architecture or adding new abstraction layers
- Performance optimizations beyond basic code cleanup

## Subtasks

- [ ] Analyze current linting errors and categorize by type and severity
- [ ] Fix unused variable and import declarations
- [ ] Resolve unbound method references in repository and service classes
- [ ] Replace unsafe `any` types with proper TypeScript interfaces
- [ ] Fix async function await expression issues
- [ ] Address remaining TypeScript compiler warnings
- [ ] Run comprehensive test suite to verify functionality preservation
- [ ] Perform final linting verification and documentation
