# Task: Context-Dependent Attribute Handling Implementation

## Description

Implement context-dependent attribute handling that separates entities by scope (dish vs restaurant attributes) referencing section 4.2.2's entity type definitions as specified in PRD section 9.2.1.

## Goal / Objectives

Create a system that correctly identifies and separates context-dependent attributes into proper entity scopes during entity resolution.

- Implement scope determination logic for context-dependent attributes
- Create separate dish_attribute vs restaurant_attribute entity handling
- Ensure proper entity type resolution based on context
- Integrate with LLM output processing and entity resolution

## Acceptance Criteria

Specific, measurable conditions that must be met for this task to be considered 'done'.

- [x] Context-dependent attributes (Italian, vegan, etc.) resolve to correct scope
- [x] Dish attributes create dish_attribute entities with proper type
- [x] Restaurant attributes create restaurant_attribute entities with proper type
- [x] Scope determination logic correctly identifies context from LLM output
- [x] System handles ambiguous attributes by creating separate entities per scope
- [x] Integration works with entity resolution system and LLM processing

## PRD References

**IMPLEMENTS PRD REQUIREMENTS:**

- **Sprint Context**: Sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9.2, 10 - Complete M02 milestone context
- **Specific Focus**: Section 9.2.1 - Context-dependent attribute handling: Separate entities by scope (dish vs restaurant attributes)
- **Entity Design**: Section 4.2.2 - Entity Type Definitions (Context-dependent attributes exist as separate entities based on scope)
- **Resolution Process**: Section 5.2.1 - Resolution Process Flow (Scope-aware resolution process)
- **Data Model**: Section 4.1 - Core Database Schema (dish_attribute vs restaurant_attribute entity types)
- **Processing Flow**: Section 6.3.2 - LLM Output Structure (attribute classification and context determination)
- **Architecture**: Section 3.1.2 - API Modular Monolith Structure (context determination service in content-processing)
- **Roadmap validation**: Task belongs in M02 foundation phase per PRD sections 9.2

**SCOPE BOUNDARIES FROM PRD:**

- **NOT implementing**: Advanced context inference beyond basic LLM output
- **NOT implementing**: Cross-scope attribute analysis (future optimization)
- **NOT implementing**: User-facing attribute management features

## Subtasks

A checklist of smaller steps to complete this task.

- [x] Create context determination service in content-processing domain
- [x] Implement scope identification logic for attributes  
- [x] Create dish_attribute entity handling with proper type constraints
- [x] Create restaurant_attribute entity handling with proper type constraints
- [x] Implement context-dependent entity resolution
- [x] Integrate with LLM output processing from T01_S01
- [x] Integrate with entity resolution system from T02_S01
- [x] Write unit tests for context-dependent scenarios
- [x] Test with sample attributes like "Italian", "vegan", "patio"
