# Task: Alias Management System Implementation

## Description

Implement automatic alias creation, duplicate prevention, and scope-aware resolution for the entity resolution system as specified in PRD section 9.2.1.

## Goal / Objectives

Create a robust alias management system that prevents duplicates and maintains proper scope awareness when merging entities.

- Implement automatic alias creation when merging entities
- Create duplicate prevention logic
- Ensure scope-aware resolution maintains entity type integrity
- Integrate with the entity resolution system

## Acceptance Criteria

Specific, measurable conditions that must be met for this task to be considered 'done'.

- [ ] Automatic alias creation adds original text when merging entities
- [ ] Duplicate prevention logic prevents duplicate aliases in arrays
- [ ] Scope-aware resolution maintains entity type constraints
- [ ] System prevents cross-scope alias pollution (dish vs restaurant attributes)
- [ ] Alias management integrates seamlessly with entity resolution system
- [ ] Unit tests cover all alias management scenarios

## PRD References

**IMPLEMENTS PRD REQUIREMENTS:**

- Section 9.2.1: Alias management - Automatic alias creation, duplicate prevention, scope-aware resolution
- Section 5.2.1: Resolution Process Flow - Phase 3 Batched Processing Pipeline
- Section 4.2.2: Entity Type Definitions - Context-dependent attribute scope handling
- **Roadmap validation**: Task belongs in M02 foundation phase per PRD sections 9.2

**SCOPE BOUNDARIES FROM PRD:**

- **NOT implementing**: Advanced alias similarity detection beyond basic duplicate prevention
- **NOT implementing**: Alias cleanup or optimization features
- **NOT implementing**: User-facing alias management (future milestone feature)

## Subtasks

A checklist of smaller steps to complete this task.

- [ ] Create alias management utilities in entity-resolver module
- [ ] Implement automatic alias creation logic
- [ ] Create duplicate prevention for alias arrays
- [ ] Implement scope-aware resolution constraints
- [ ] Add alias management to entity merge operations
- [ ] Integrate with entity resolution system from T02_S01
- [ ] Write unit tests for alias management scenarios
- [ ] Test with sample entity merge operations
