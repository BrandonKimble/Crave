# Task: LLM Integration API Setup

## Description

Establish LLM integration for the content processing pipeline with API connectivity and structured input/output handling. This creates the foundation for entity extraction from community content as required by the PRD for M02.

## Goal / Objectives

Implement LLM API integration that can process test content and extract structured entity data for the entity resolution system.

- Set up LLM API client with proper authentication and error handling
- Implement structured input/output handling for entity extraction
- Create test data processing functionality
- Ensure integration follows external integrations module architecture

## Acceptance Criteria

Specific, measurable conditions that must be met for this task to be considered 'done'.

- [ ] LLM API client successfully connects and authenticates
- [ ] Structured input/output handling processes test content correctly
- [ ] Entity extraction returns properly formatted JSON with entities and attributes
- [ ] Basic error handling and retry logic implemented
- [ ] Integration passes end-to-end test with sample Reddit content

## PRD References

**IMPLEMENTS PRD REQUIREMENTS:**

- Section 9.2.1: LLM integration - API connectivity, structured input/output handling
- Section 6.3.1: LLM Input Structure - Batch processing for posts/comments
- Section 6.3.2: LLM Output Structure - Structured mentions with temp IDs
- **Roadmap validation**: Task belongs in M02 foundation phase per PRD sections 9.2

**SCOPE BOUNDARIES FROM PRD:**

- **NOT implementing**: Data collection from Reddit API (deferred to M03 - PRD section 9.3)
- **NOT implementing**: Advanced retry strategies beyond basic implementation
- **NOT implementing**: Rate limiting beyond basic implementation (covered in S02_M02)

## Subtasks

A checklist of smaller steps to complete this task.

- [ ] Create LLM API client module in external-integrations domain
- [ ] Implement authentication and connection handling
- [ ] Define structured input format based on PRD section 6.3.1
- [ ] Define structured output format based on PRD section 6.3.2
- [ ] Implement basic error handling and retry logic
- [ ] Create test data processing functionality
- [ ] Write unit tests for LLM integration
- [ ] Test end-to-end processing with sample content
