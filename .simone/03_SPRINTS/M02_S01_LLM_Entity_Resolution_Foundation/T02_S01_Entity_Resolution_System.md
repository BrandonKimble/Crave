# Task: Complete Entity Resolution System Implementation

## Description

Implement the three-phase entity resolution system with LLM normalization, database matching (exact, alias, fuzzy), and batched processing pipeline as specified in PRD section 9.2.1.

## Goal / Objectives

Create a complete entity resolution system that can accurately match entities from LLM output to existing database entities using three-tier matching.

- Implement three-phase resolution: exact match → alias matching → fuzzy matching
- Create batched processing pipeline for performance
- Ensure proper entity type handling and scope awareness
- Integrate with existing database schema from M01

## Acceptance Criteria

Specific, measurable conditions that must be met for this task to be considered 'done'.

- [ ] Three-phase resolution system correctly handles exact matches
- [ ] Alias matching works with existing entity aliases array
- [ ] Fuzzy matching identifies similar entities with confidence scoring
- [ ] Batched processing handles multiple entities efficiently
- [ ] System correctly differentiates entity types (restaurant, dish_or_category, etc.)
- [ ] Integration works with existing database schema and repositories

## PRD References

**IMPLEMENTS PRD REQUIREMENTS:**

- **Sprint Context**: Sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9.2, 10 - Complete M02 milestone context
- **Specific Focus**: Section 9.2.1 - Complete entity resolution system: Three-phase system with LLM normalization, database matching, batched processing
- **Process Flow**: Section 5.2.1 - Resolution Process Flow (Phase 2 Database Entity Resolution)
- **Optimization**: Section 5.2.2 - Entity Resolution Optimization (Three-tier resolution process)
- **Data Model**: Section 4.1 - Core Database Schema (entities table structure and relationships)
- **Architecture**: Section 3.1.2 - API Modular Monolith Structure (content-processing domain)
- **Technology**: Section 2.3 - Data Layer (Prisma ORM integration)
- **Roadmap validation**: Task belongs in M02 foundation phase per PRD sections 9.2

**SCOPE BOUNDARIES FROM PRD:**

- **NOT implementing**: Performance optimizations beyond basic implementation (deferred to Post-MVP)
- **NOT implementing**: Advanced fuzzy matching algorithms (basic edit distance sufficient)
- **NOT implementing**: Query processing application (deferred to M04)

## Subtasks

A checklist of smaller steps to complete this task.

- [ ] Create entity resolution service in content-processing domain
- [ ] Implement exact match resolution using database queries
- [ ] Implement alias matching with array operations
- [ ] Implement basic fuzzy matching with edit distance
- [ ] Create batched processing pipeline with in-memory ID mapping
- [ ] Add entity type awareness and scope handling
- [ ] Integrate with existing entity repositories from M01
- [ ] Write comprehensive unit tests for all resolution phases
- [ ] Test with sample LLM output data
