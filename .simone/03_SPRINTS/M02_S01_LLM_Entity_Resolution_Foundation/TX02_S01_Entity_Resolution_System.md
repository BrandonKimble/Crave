# Task: Complete Entity Resolution System Implementation

## Description

Implement the three-phase entity resolution system with LLM normalization, database matching (exact, alias, fuzzy), and batched processing pipeline as specified in PRD section 9.2.1.

## Goal / Objectives

Create a complete entity resolution system that can accurately match entities from LLM output to existing database entities using three-tier matching.

- Implement three-phase resolution: exact match → alias matching → fuzzy matching
- Create batched processing pipeline for performance
- Ensure proper entity type handling and scope awareness
- Integrate with existing database schema from M01

## Acceptance Criteria

Specific, measurable conditions that must be met for this task to be considered 'done'.

- [x] Three-phase resolution system correctly handles exact matches
- [x] Alias matching works with existing entity aliases array
- [x] Fuzzy matching identifies similar entities with confidence scoring
- [x] Batched processing handles multiple entities efficiently
- [x] System correctly differentiates entity types (restaurant, dish_or_category, etc.)
- [x] Integration works with existing database schema and repositories
