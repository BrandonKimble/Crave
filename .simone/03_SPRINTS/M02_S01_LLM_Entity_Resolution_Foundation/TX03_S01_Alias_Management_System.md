# Task: Alias Management System Implementation

## Description

Implement automatic alias creation, duplicate prevention, and scope-aware resolution for the entity resolution system as specified in PRD section 9.2.1.

## Goal / Objectives

Create a robust alias management system that prevents duplicates and maintains proper scope awareness when merging entities.

- Implement automatic alias creation when merging entities
- Create duplicate prevention logic
- Ensure scope-aware resolution maintains entity type integrity
- Integrate with the entity resolution system

## Acceptance Criteria

Specific, measurable conditions that must be met for this task to be considered 'done'.

- [x] Automatic alias creation adds original text when merging entities
- [x] Duplicate prevention logic prevents duplicate aliases in arrays
- [x] Scope-aware resolution maintains entity type constraints
- [x] System prevents cross-scope alias pollution (dish vs restaurant attributes)
- [x] Alias management integrates seamlessly with entity resolution system
- [x] Unit tests cover all alias management scenarios

## PRD References

**IMPLEMENTS PRD REQUIREMENTS:**

- **Sprint Context**: Sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9.2, 10 - Complete M02 milestone context
- **Specific Focus**: Section 9.2.1 - Alias management: Automatic alias creation, duplicate prevention, scope-aware resolution
- **Process Integration**: Section 5.2.1 - Resolution Process Flow (Phase 3 Batched Processing Pipeline)
- **Entity Types**: Section 4.2.2 - Entity Type Definitions (Context-dependent attribute scope handling)
- **Data Model**: Section 4.1 - Core Database Schema (aliases array structure in entities table)
- **Architecture**: Section 3.1.2 - API Modular Monolith Structure (entity-resolver module in content-processing)
- **Technology**: Section 2.3 - Data Layer (PostgreSQL array operations)
- **Roadmap validation**: Task belongs in M02 foundation phase per PRD sections 9.2

**SCOPE BOUNDARIES FROM PRD:**

- **NOT implementing**: Advanced alias similarity detection beyond basic duplicate prevention
- **NOT implementing**: Alias cleanup or optimization features
- **NOT implementing**: User-facing alias management (future milestone feature)

## Subtasks

A checklist of smaller steps to complete this task.

- [x] Create alias management utilities in entity-resolver module
- [x] Implement automatic alias creation logic
- [x] Create duplicate prevention for alias arrays
- [x] Implement scope-aware resolution constraints
- [x] Add alias management to entity merge operations
- [x] Integrate with entity resolution system from T02_S01
- [x] Write unit tests for alias management scenarios
- [x] Test with sample entity merge operations

[2025-07-27 13:30:02] Infrastructure discovery complete - found existing EntityResolutionService with three-tier resolution
[2025-07-27 13:30:02] Identified key integration points: entity-resolver module, entity.repository.ts, existing alias processing
[2025-07-27 13:30:02] Phase 2: Implementation planning
[2025-07-27 13:35:00] Phase 3: Implementation complete - created AliasManagementService with core functionality
[2025-07-27 13:35:00] Completed: mergeAliases(), removeDuplicates(), validateScopeConstraints(), prepareAliasesForMerge()
[2025-07-27 13:35:00] Next: Add entity merge operations and integrate with EntityResolutionService
[2025-07-27 13:36:38] Entity merge operations added - mergeEntities(), addAliasToEntity() methods
[2025-07-27 13:36:38] Integration complete - EntityResolutionService now uses AliasManagementService in createNewEntities()
