# Task: Basic Connections CRUD - Foundation Setup

## Description

Implement basic CRUD operations for the connections table that manages relationships between restaurants and dishes/categories. This task focuses on essential database operations for connection management as part of the database foundation setup.

## Goal / Objectives

Create basic ConnectionsRepository service with essential CRUD operations for database foundation.

- Implement basic CRUD operations (create, findById, findMany, update, delete)
- Handle basic entity relationship validation
- Ensure basic constraint handling and data integrity
- Support basic connection creation and management

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] ConnectionsRepository class implements basic CRUD operations (create, findById, findMany, update, delete)
- [x] Basic entity relationship validation ensures valid restaurant and dish connections
- [x] Basic connection constraints are properly handled
- [x] Basic integration with Entity repository for relationship validation
- [x] Basic error handling for constraint violations
- [x] Repository follows established patterns from other entity repositories
- [x] Basic JSDoc documentation

## Dependencies

- **T01_S02**: Repository Layer Foundation - Requires base repository infrastructure and patterns
- **T02_S02**: Database Configuration & Connection Pooling - Requires optimized database connection setup
- **T03_S02**: Error Handling & Validation - Requires error handling infrastructure for database operations
- **T04_S02**: Logging Infrastructure - Requires logging setup for repository operations
- **T05_S02**: Entities Repository Layer - Requires entities repository for connection validation

## PRD References

- Section 4.2.4.3: Unified Entity Model Implementation - Entity resolution service implementation
- Section 3.4: Development Principles - Repository pattern implementation
- Section 2.7: Development Tools - Database architecture patterns

## Subtasks

- [x] Create ConnectionsRepository class with Prisma integration
- [x] Implement basic CRUD operations (create, findById, findMany, update, delete)
- [x] Add basic connection validation logic with entity existence checks
- [x] Implement basic entity type validation (restaurant -> dish_or_category)
- [x] Handle basic constraint violations
- [x] Add basic attribute and category existence validation
- [x] Write basic JSDoc documentation
- [x] Export repository through connections module
- [x] Create basic unit tests for CRUD operations

## Technical Guidance

### Connections Table Schema and Foreign Key Relationships

The connections table has the following key structure:
- **connectionId**: UUID primary key
- **restaurantId**: Foreign key to entities table (restaurant type)
- **dishOrCategoryId**: Foreign key to entities table (dish_or_category type)
- **categories**: Array of UUID references to category entities
- **dishAttributes**: Array of UUID references to attribute entities
- **Metadata**: isMenuItem boolean flag

### Connection Type Handling and Validation

Basic connection validation requirements:
- **Entity Type Validation**: restaurantId must reference restaurant entity, dishOrCategoryId must reference dish_or_category entity
- **Basic Constraint**: Ensure valid restaurant and dish combinations
- **Basic Attribute Validation**: Verify attributes exist as dish_attribute entities
- **Basic Category Validation**: Verify categories exist as dish_or_category entities

### Integration with Entities Repository

Basic connection operations:
- **Pre-creation Checks**: Verify referenced entities exist and have correct types
- **Basic Operations**: Handle entity connections with essential validation
- **Simple Queries**: Basic operations for connection data

## Implementation Notes

### Connection CRUD Operations with Entity Validation

```typescript
interface CreateConnectionDto {
  restaurantId: string;
  dishOrCategoryId: string;
  categories?: string[];
  dishAttributes?: string[];
  isMenuItem?: boolean;
}

// Pre-creation validation
async create(dto: CreateConnectionDto): Promise<Connection> {
  // 1. Validate restaurant entity exists and is type 'restaurant'
  // 2. Validate dish entity exists and is type 'dish_or_category'
  // 3. Basic validation for attributes and categories
  // 4. Create connection with basic constraint handling
}
```

### Connection Integrity Constraints

Maintain basic data integrity:
- **Foreign Key Constraints**: Proper entity references
- **Basic Constraints**: Essential connection validation
- **Basic Operations**: Handle entity connections appropriately
