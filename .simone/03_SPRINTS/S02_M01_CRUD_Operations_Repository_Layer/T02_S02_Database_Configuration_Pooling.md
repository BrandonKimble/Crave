# Task: Database Configuration and Connection Pooling - Foundation Setup

## Description

Configure Prisma service with optimized connection pooling, database settings, and performance tuning for production-ready operations. The current PrismaService implementation is basic and lacks the connection pooling configuration, performance monitoring, and environment-specific optimizations needed for a production system handling high-volume Reddit data processing and real-time search queries.

This task will enhance the existing Prisma configuration to support scalable database operations with proper connection management, performance optimization, and monitoring capabilities.

## Goal / Objectives

Implement production-ready database configuration with optimized connection pooling and performance tuning to support:

- Efficient database connection management for concurrent operations
- Environment-specific configuration (development, staging, production)
- Performance monitoring and health checks
- Proper connection lifecycle management
- Scalable connection pool sizing for high-volume operations

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Connection pool configuration with optimized sizing (50 connections MVP, 100+ for scale)
- [ ] Environment-specific database configuration management
- [ ] Connection lifecycle management with proper cleanup
- [ ] Database performance monitoring and health checks
- [ ] Configuration validation and error handling
- [ ] Integration with existing NestJS configuration module
- [ ] Database connection retry logic and timeout handling
- [ ] Performance metrics collection for connection pool utilization
- [ ] Documentation of configuration options and optimization guidelines

## Dependencies

- **T01_S02**: Repository Layer Foundation - Requires base repository infrastructure and PrismaService setup

## PRD References

- Section 4.2.1: Database architecture requirements for PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- Section 6.1.2: Performance requirements for sub-500ms query response times
- Section 6.2.1: Scalability requirements supporting 10k+ concurrent users
- Section 7.3.1: Infrastructure requirements for production database configuration

## Subtasks

- [ ] Analyze current PrismaService configuration and identify optimization opportunities
- [ ] Design connection pool configuration structure with environment-specific settings
- [ ] Implement enhanced PrismaService with connection pooling configuration
- [ ] Add database configuration validation and error handling
- [ ] Integrate with existing NestJS ConfigModule for environment management
- [ ] Implement database health check and monitoring endpoints
- [ ] Add connection pool metrics and performance monitoring
- [ ] Configure retry logic and timeout handling for database connections
- [ ] Create configuration documentation and deployment guidelines
- [ ] Test connection pool behavior under high load scenarios
- [ ] Validate configuration across development, staging, and production environments

## Technical Guidance

**Prisma Service Configuration Patterns:**
- Extend PrismaClient with custom configuration options for connection pooling
- Implement environment-specific database URL and connection parameters
- Configure connection pool size based on application load requirements
- Use Prisma's built-in connection pooling with pgBouncer compatibility
- Implement proper connection lifecycle hooks (onModuleInit, onModuleDestroy)

**Connection Pooling Optimization:**
- MVP configuration: 50 database connections for initial load
- Scale configuration: 100+ connections for high-volume operations
- Configure connection timeout and idle timeout parameters
- Implement connection pool monitoring and alerting
- Use connection pool sizing based on concurrent user requirements

**Database Performance Tuning:**
- Configure query timeout settings for long-running operations
- Implement connection retry logic with exponential backoff
- Add database connection health checks and monitoring
- Configure statement timeout for query performance optimization
- Implement connection pool warmup for faster application startup

**Environment-Specific Configuration:**
- Development: Smaller pool size (5-10 connections) with detailed logging
- Staging: Mid-size pool (20-30 connections) with performance monitoring
- Production: Optimized pool size (50-100+ connections) with minimal logging
- Use environment variables for dynamic configuration management
- Implement configuration validation for required database parameters

**Integration with NestJS Configuration Module:**
- Extend existing configuration.ts with database-specific settings
- Use ConfigService for dynamic configuration injection
- Implement configuration schema validation with Joi or class-validator
- Add configuration hot-reload capabilities for development
- Create typed configuration interfaces for better development experience

## Implementation Notes

**Connection Pool Sizing and Optimization:**
- Calculate pool size based on expected concurrent operations
- Consider CPU cores, memory constraints, and application threads
- Monitor connection pool utilization and adjust sizing dynamically
- Implement connection pool health monitoring and alerting
- Use connection pool metrics to optimize performance

**Database Connection Lifecycle Management:**
- Implement graceful connection initialization and cleanup
- Add connection state monitoring and recovery mechanisms
- Handle connection interruptions and automatic reconnection
- Implement connection pool warming strategies
- Configure connection validation and health checking

**Configuration Validation and Error Handling:**
- Validate database connection parameters at startup
- Implement comprehensive error handling for connection failures
- Add configuration schema validation with detailed error messages
- Create fallback mechanisms for configuration errors
- Implement configuration change detection and hot-reload

**Performance Monitoring Setup:**
- Add connection pool utilization metrics collection
- Implement query performance monitoring and logging
- Create database health check endpoints for monitoring systems
- Add connection latency and throughput metrics
- Integrate with application monitoring and alerting systems

**Environment-Specific Settings Management:**
- Create environment-specific configuration templates
- Implement configuration inheritance and overrides
- Add configuration validation for different environments
- Create deployment-specific configuration management
- Implement configuration encryption for sensitive parameters
