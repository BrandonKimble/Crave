# Sprint: Database Foundation & Basic Setup - Repository Layer Implementation (S02)

## Sprint Goal

Implement the database foundation and basic repository patterns for essential entity operations.

## Scope & Key Deliverables

- **Repository pattern implementation** for all entity types (entities, connections, mentions, users)
- **Complete CRUD operations** (create, read, update, delete) for each entity type
- **Service layer architecture** following NestJS dependency injection patterns
- **Entity modules and providers** properly structured and exported
- **Error handling and validation** for database operations
- **Connection pooling optimization** and database configuration
- **Basic logging** for database operations and errors

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)

- ✅ Repository classes implemented for all entity types
- ✅ All CRUD operations functional and tested manually
- ✅ Service layer properly implements business logic patterns
- ✅ NestJS modules structured with proper dependency injection
- ✅ Error handling captures and logs database operation failures
- ✅ Connection pooling is configured and functional
- ✅ All repository operations use Prisma client with proper typing

## Sprint Tasks

### Database Foundation & Basic Setup
- **T01_S02** - Repository Layer Foundation (Medium)
- **T02_S02** - Database Configuration & Connection Pooling (Medium)
- **T03_S02** - Error Handling & Validation Layer (Medium)  
- **T04_S02** - Logging Infrastructure (Medium)
- **T05_S02** - Entities Repository Layer (Medium)
- **T06_S02** - Basic Connections CRUD Operations (Medium)
- **T07_S02** - Entities Service Layer (Medium)

## Task Dependencies

**Sequential Database Foundation Setup:**
1. T01 (Repository Foundation) → prerequisite for all subsequent tasks
2. T02 (Database Configuration) → depends on T01, prerequisite for database operations
3. T03 (Error Handling) → depends on T01, T02, integrates with all subsequent tasks
4. T04 (Logging) → depends on T01, T02, T03, integrates with all subsequent tasks
5. T05 (Entities Repository) → depends on T01-T04, foundation for entity operations
6. T06 (Basic Connections CRUD) → depends on T01-T05, requires entities repository
7. T07 (Entities Service) → depends on T01-T06, builds service layer on repository foundation

## Notes / Retrospective Points

This sprint builds directly on Sprint 1's database schema. Focus is on creating clean, maintainable data access patterns following NestJS best practices. The repository pattern provides abstraction that will enable easier testing in Sprint 3 and future development.

**Task Complexity Distribution:**
- Medium Complexity: 13 tasks (after splitting and scope reduction)
- Low Complexity: 0 tasks
- High Complexity: 0 tasks (all split to Medium)

**Task Splitting Summary:**
- Original T02 (Entities) split into T12, T13, T14 for separation of concerns
- Original T03 (Connections) split into T02, T04 for CRUD/queries (T03 quality scoring deferred to Milestone 5)
- Original T05 (Users) split into T08, T09, T10 for core/auth/business logic
- Original T04 (Mentions) renumbered to T11

**Scope Adjustments:**
- T03 (Connections Quality Scoring) removed - deferred to Milestone 5 per PRD roadmap
- Quality score fields remain in schema but computation algorithms delayed until proper milestone

**Implementation Order:** Sequential database foundation setup with T01→T02→T03→T04→T05→T06→T07.
