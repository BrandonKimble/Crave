# Sprint: CRUD Operations & Repository Layer - Business Logic Implementation (S02)

## Sprint Goal

Implement the repository pattern and complete CRUD operations for all entity types with proper service layer architecture.

## Scope & Key Deliverables

- **Repository pattern implementation** for all entity types (entities, connections, mentions, users)
- **Complete CRUD operations** (create, read, update, delete) for each entity type
- **Service layer architecture** following NestJS dependency injection patterns
- **Entity modules and providers** properly structured and exported
- **Error handling and validation** for database operations
- **Connection pooling optimization** and database configuration
- **Basic logging** for database operations and errors

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)

- ✅ Repository classes implemented for all entity types
- ✅ All CRUD operations functional and tested manually
- ✅ Service layer properly implements business logic patterns
- ✅ NestJS modules structured with proper dependency injection
- ✅ Error handling captures and logs database operation failures
- ✅ Connection pooling is configured and functional
- ✅ All repository operations use Prisma client with proper typing

## Notes / Retrospective Points

This sprint builds directly on Sprint 1's database schema. Focus is on creating clean, maintainable data access patterns following NestJS best practices. The repository pattern provides abstraction that will enable easier testing in Sprint 3 and future development.
