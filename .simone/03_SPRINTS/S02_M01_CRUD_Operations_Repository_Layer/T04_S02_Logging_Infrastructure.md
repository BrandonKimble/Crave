# Task: Logging Infrastructure - Foundation Setup

## Description

Implement comprehensive logging infrastructure using Winston for database operations, errors, and performance monitoring. This task establishes centralized, structured logging across the API to support debugging, monitoring, and observability requirements for the CRUD operations and repository layer.

The current codebase uses basic NestJS Logger in some services but lacks a unified logging strategy. This implementation will provide consistent log formatting, appropriate log levels, structured data capture, and integration with all repository operations.

## Goal / Objectives

Establish a robust logging foundation that supports development debugging, production monitoring, and performance analysis across all API operations.

- Create centralized Winston logger configuration with environment-specific settings
- Implement structured logging patterns with consistent metadata capture
- Integrate comprehensive logging into all repository operations (CRUD)
- Establish error logging with stack trace capture and context preservation
- Set up performance metrics logging for database operations and API responses
- Configure log rotation and retention policies for production environments

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Winston logger service is configured and available through NestJS DI container
- [x] Log levels are properly configured for development vs production environments
- [x] All repository operations (entities, connections, mentions) include operation logging
- [x] Database queries are logged with execution time and query metadata
- [x] Error logging captures full context including stack traces and request metadata
- [x] Performance metrics are logged for response times and database operation timing
- [x] Log rotation is configured with appropriate retention policies
- [x] Structured logging format includes timestamps, levels, context, and correlation IDs
- [x] Logger integration works seamlessly across all existing modules (Reddit, Prisma, etc.)

## Technical Guidance

### Winston Logger Configuration and Setup

**Core Configuration Structure:**
- Create `src/shared/logging/logger.module.ts` for centralized configuration
- Use `WinstonModule.forRootAsync()` from nest-winston for NestJS integration
- Configure multiple transports: console for development, file rotation for production
- Implement custom log formatters with structured JSON output

**Environment-Specific Settings:**
```typescript
// Development: Console with colors and readable format
// Production: JSON format with file rotation and error separation
// Test: Silent or minimal logging to avoid noise
```

**Log Level Management:**
- DEBUG: Detailed operation tracking, query logging
- INFO: General operation flow, successful completions
- WARN: Recoverable errors, performance issues
- ERROR: Failed operations, exceptions with stack traces

### Log Levels and Structured Logging Patterns

**Structured Log Format:**
```typescript
{
  timestamp: ISO8601,
  level: string,
  message: string,
  context: string, // Service/module name
  correlationId?: string,
  userId?: string,
  operation?: string,
  duration?: number,
  metadata?: object,
  error?: { message, stack, code }
}
```

**Operation Logging Patterns:**
- Start/End logging for repository operations
- Query logging with sanitized parameters
- Performance timing with operation context
- Error context preservation with full stack traces

### Database Operation Logging Integration

**PrismaService Integration:**
- Extend PrismaService to include operation logging
- Log all CRUD operations with timing and context
- Capture query metadata without exposing sensitive data
- Track connection pool metrics and query performance

**Repository Method Logging:**
```typescript
// Pattern for repository methods
async findEntity(id: string): Promise<Entity> {
  const startTime = Date.now();
  this.logger.debug('Starting entity lookup', { operation: 'findEntity', entityId: id });
  
  try {
    const result = await this.prisma.entity.findUnique({ where: { id } });
    const duration = Date.now() - startTime;
    
    this.logger.info('Entity lookup completed', {
      operation: 'findEntity',
      entityId: id,
      duration,
      found: !!result
    });
    
    return result;
  } catch (error) {
    this.logger.error('Entity lookup failed', {
      operation: 'findEntity',
      entityId: id,
      duration: Date.now() - startTime,
      error: { message: error.message, stack: error.stack }
    });
    throw error;
  }
}
```

### Error Logging and Stack Trace Capture

**Error Context Preservation:**
- Capture full error context including request metadata
- Preserve error chains and cause relationships
- Include correlation IDs for request tracking
- Sanitize sensitive data while maintaining debugging capability

**Exception Filter Integration:**
- Create global exception filter for consistent error logging
- Capture HTTP context (method, URL, headers, body)
- Log error severity based on error type and HTTP status
- Include user context and session information when available

### Performance Metrics Logging

**Database Performance Tracking:**
- Log query execution times with percentile tracking
- Monitor connection pool utilization
- Track slow query identification and optimization opportunities
- Capture transaction timing and rollback scenarios

**API Performance Monitoring:**
- Request/response timing with route-specific metrics
- External API call performance (Reddit API)
- Memory usage and garbage collection impact tracking
- Queue processing performance for background jobs

## Implementation Notes

### Logger Service Configuration and DI Integration

**Module Structure:**
```typescript
// src/shared/logging/logger.module.ts
@Module({
  imports: [
    WinstonModule.forRootAsync({
      useFactory: (configService: ConfigService) => ({
        // Winston configuration based on environment
      }),
      inject: [ConfigService],
    }),
  ],
  providers: [LoggerService],
  exports: [LoggerService],
})
export class LoggerModule {}
```

**Service Implementation:**
- Extend Winston logger with NestJS-specific context methods
- Provide typed logging methods for different operation categories
- Include correlation ID and request context injection
- Support both sync and async logging patterns

### Repository Operation Logging Implementation

**Integration Approach:**
- Use dependency injection to provide logger to all repository services
- Implement consistent logging decorators for repository methods
- Create base repository class with built-in logging capabilities
- Ensure logging doesn't impact transaction boundaries

**Performance Considerations:**
- Use async logging where possible to avoid blocking operations
- Implement log level checking to avoid expensive string interpolation
- Configure appropriate buffer sizes for high-throughput scenarios
- Consider structured logging impact on JSON parsing overhead

### Error Tracking and Alerting Setup

**Error Classification:**
- Business logic errors vs system errors
- Recoverable vs non-recoverable errors
- Client errors (4xx) vs server errors (5xx)
- Integration errors with external services

**Alerting Integration Points:**
- Prepare log format for external monitoring tools
- Include severity levels for automated alerting
- Support error aggregation and deduplication
- Maintain error correlation across microservice boundaries

### Log Rotation and Retention Policies

**File Management:**
```typescript
// winston-daily-rotate-file configuration
{
  filename: 'application-%DATE%.log',
  datePattern: 'YYYY-MM-DD',
  maxSize: '20m',
  maxFiles: '14d', // Retain 14 days
  zippedArchive: true
}
```

**Environment-Specific Retention:**
- Development: 3-7 days retention
- Staging: 30 days retention
- Production: 90 days retention with archival strategy

### Development vs Production Logging Differences

**Development Environment:**
- Human-readable console output with colors
- Verbose logging including DEBUG level
- Pretty-printed JSON for structured data
- Immediate console output for debugging

**Production Environment:**
- JSON-only structured logging
- INFO level and above only
- File-based logging with rotation
- Error logs separated from general logs
- Performance-optimized minimal overhead logging

**Testing Environment:**
- Silent logging or test-specific minimal output
- Mock logger for unit test isolation
- Structured assertion capabilities for log testing
- Performance impact measurement for logging overhead
