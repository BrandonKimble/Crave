# Task: Seed Data and Schema Validation

## Description

Create comprehensive seed data for the complete database schema and implement basic validation procedures to ensure the schema works correctly. This task involves creating realistic test data that covers all entity types, relationships, and edge cases defined in the PRD, along with basic validation queries to verify schema integrity and database functionality.

The seed data will serve as the foundation for development, testing, and demonstration purposes, providing realistic data patterns that mirror real-world usage scenarios from Reddit food community discussions.

## Goal / Objectives

Establish a robust data foundation that validates the complete schema implementation and provides realistic test data for Sprint S01 completion:

- Create comprehensive seed data covering all entity types and relationships defined in the schema
- Validate schema integrity through direct Prisma operations and SQL queries
- Establish realistic data patterns for development and future sprint work
- Verify basic performance characteristics of the database schema
- Create basic validation queries to confirm schema correctness

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Prisma seed script successfully creates all entity types with realistic data
- [x] All relationship patterns from PRD section 4.1 are represented in seed data
- [x] Basic SQL validation queries confirm data integrity and referential constraints
- [x] Seed data includes edge cases and boundary conditions for schema testing
- [x] Basic documentation exists for seed data structure and validation approach
- [x] All database constraints and indexes function correctly with seed data

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Seed Script Architecture

```typescript
// apps/api/prisma/seed.ts
import { PrismaClient, EntityType } from '@prisma/client';

const prisma = new PrismaClient();

async function main() {
  // 1. Clear existing data in proper order (respecting foreign keys)
  // 2. Create restaurant entities with Austin food scene data
  // 3. Create dish/category entities with realistic food items
  // 4. Create attribute entities (both dish and restaurant scoped)
  // 5. Establish connections with quality scores and mentions
  // 6. Run basic validation queries to confirm schema integrity
}
```

### Entity Creation Patterns

**Restaurant Entities:**

- Include real Austin restaurants (Ramen Tatsu-Ya, Franklin BBQ, etc.)
- Add Google Places data (lat/lng, address, place_id)
- Generate realistic quality scores based on mention patterns
- Include restaurant_attributes array with relevant UUIDs

**Dish/Category Entities:**

- Create both specific menu items and general categories
- Include alias arrays with name variations
- Cover major food categories and popular Austin dishes
- Ensure proper normalization following PRD guidelines

**Attribute Entities:**

- Create context-dependent attributes (Italian, vegan, etc.) as separate entities
- Generate both dish_attribute and restaurant_attribute versions
- Include descriptive and selective attribute types
- Follow PRD section 4.2.2 scope definitions

### Connection Data Patterns

**Restaurant-to-Dish Connections:**

- Use realistic quality scores (0.0-10.0 range)
- Include proper mention_count and upvote data
- Add categories and dish_attributes arrays with UUIDs
- Set is_menu_item flag appropriately
- Include top_mentions JSONB with sample Reddit data

**Sample Connection Structure:**

```sql
-- Connection: Franklin BBQ → Brisket
restaurant_id: franklin_bbq_uuid
dish_or_category_id: brisket_uuid
categories: [bbq_category_uuid, meat_category_uuid]
dish_attributes: [smoky_uuid, tender_uuid]
is_menu_item: true
mention_count: 45
total_upvotes: 312
dish_quality_score: 8.7
```

### Validation Procedures

**Schema Integrity Tests:**

```sql
-- Verify all connections reference valid entities
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM connections c
LEFT JOIN entities r ON c.restaurant_id = r.entity_id
LEFT JOIN entities d ON c.dish_or_category_id = d.entity_id
WHERE r.entity_id IS NULL OR d.entity_id IS NULL;

-- Validate entity type constraints
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM connections c
JOIN entities r ON c.restaurant_id = r.entity_id
WHERE r.type != 'restaurant';
```

**Basic Performance Checks:**

- Seed data insertion time benchmarks
- Index usage verification for basic queries
- Simple geographic query performance with trigram indexes
- Connection filtering with attribute arrays

### Sample Data Specifications

**Restaurant Count:** 50-100 Austin area restaurants
**Dish/Category Count:** 200-300 food items and categories  
**Attribute Count:** 100+ attributes (50 dish, 50 restaurant scoped)
**Connection Count:** 500-1000 restaurant-dish relationships
**Mention Count:** 100-200 sample Reddit mentions per major connection

**Geographic Coverage:** Focus on Austin metro area with realistic lat/lng coordinates
**Quality Score Distribution:** Follow realistic patterns with high-performing establishments having scores 7.0+
**Attribute Diversity:** Include cuisine types, dietary restrictions, preparation methods, ambiance descriptors
