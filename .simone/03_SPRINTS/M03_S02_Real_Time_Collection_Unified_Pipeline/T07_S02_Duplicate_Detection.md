# Task: Duplicate Detection

## Description

Implement duplicate detection to prevent duplicate processing of overlapping content between Pushshift archives and Reddit API sources as specified in PRD sections 5.1.2 and 6.1, ensuring data integrity and processing efficiency.

## Goal / Objectives

- Prevent duplicate processing of content appearing in both data sources
- Identify overlapping content between archives and API collection
- Maintain data integrity while avoiding redundant processing
- Optimize processing performance by eliminating duplicates

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Duplicate detection identifies overlapping content between Pushshift and Reddit API
- [ ] System prevents duplicate processing of same posts/comments
- [ ] Detection logic handles content ID matching across data sources
- [ ] Performance remains efficient with large datasets
- [ ] Integration with processing pipeline prevents redundant LLM analysis
- [ ] Duplicate tracking provides visibility into overlap patterns

## PRD References

**IMPLEMENTS PRD REQUIREMENTS:**

- Section 5.1.2: Duplicate detection - Prevent duplicate processing of overlapping content
- Section 6.1: Step 4 - Duplicate Detection between archives and API
- Section 9.3.2: Success Criteria - "Data merge logic correctly handles overlapping content"

**BROADER CONTEXT:**

- Section 1: Overview & Core System Architecture (all subsections) - Data processing efficiency
- Section 2: Technology Stack (all subsections) - Data processing and storage optimization
- Section 3: Hybrid Monorepo & Modular Monolith Architecture (all subsections) - Content processing domain
- Section 4: Data Model & Database Architecture (all subsections) - Data integrity constraints
- Section 5: Data Collection Strategy & Architecture (all subsections) - Hybrid approach challenges
- Section 6: Reddit Data Collection Process (all subsections) - Processing pipeline integration
- Section 9: PRE-MVP Implementation Roadmap (all subsections) - Milestone context and boundaries
- Section 10: POST-MVP Roadmap (all subsections) - Future roadmap and scaling considerations

**SCOPE BOUNDARIES FROM PRD:**

- **NOT implementing**: Advanced similarity detection beyond ID matching (basic duplicate prevention)
- **NOT implementing**: Content fingerprinting or fuzzy matching (exact ID comparison)
- **NOT implementing**: Cross-subreddit duplicate detection (single subreddit focus)

## Subtasks

- [ ] Design duplicate detection algorithm using post/comment IDs
- [ ] Implement content ID matching between data sources
- [ ] Create duplicate tracking and logging system
- [ ] Integrate duplicate detection with processing pipeline
- [ ] Add performance optimization for large-scale duplicate checking
- [ ] Implement duplicate statistics and reporting
- [ ] Handle edge cases like deleted or modified content
- [ ] Write tests for duplicate detection accuracy and performance
