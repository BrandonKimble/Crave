# Task: Data Merge Logic

## Description

Implement data merge logic to combine historical Pushshift archives (from S01) and real-time Reddit API data by timestamp, preventing gaps and ensuring seamless integration as specified in PRD sections 5.1.2 and 6.1.

## Goal / Objectives

- Merge historical and real-time data sources by timestamp
- Prevent data gaps between archive and API collection periods
- Ensure temporal consistency across combined dataset
- Integrate seamlessly with existing processing pipeline

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Merge logic correctly combines archive and API data by timestamp
- [ ] Temporal ordering is maintained across both data sources
- [ ] Data gaps between archive end date and API start date are minimized
- [ ] Merged data maintains source attribution and metadata
- [ ] Integration with existing M02 LLM processing pipeline is functional
- [ ] Merge process handles timezone and timestamp format differences

## PRD References

**IMPLEMENTS PRD REQUIREMENTS:**

- Section 5.1.2: Data merge logic - Combine historical and real-time data by timestamp
- Section 6.1: Step 4 - Temporal Merging between archive data and API data
- Section 5.1.2: Gap Minimization Strategy - Overlap detection and bidirectional enrichment

**BROADER CONTEXT:**

- Section 1: Overview & Core System Architecture (all subsections) - Data collection flow integration
- Section 2: Technology Stack (all subsections) - Data processing and storage
- Section 3: Hybrid Monorepo & Modular Monolith Architecture (all subsections) - Content processing domain
- Section 4: Data Model & Database Architecture (all subsections) - Data structure consistency
- Section 5: Data Collection Strategy & Architecture (all subsections) - Hybrid approach design
- Section 6: Reddit Data Collection Process (all subsections) - Processing pipeline context
- Section 9: PRE-MVP Implementation Roadmap (all subsections) - Milestone context and boundaries
- Section 10: POST-MVP Roadmap (all subsections) - Future roadmap and scaling considerations

**SCOPE BOUNDARIES FROM PRD:**

- **NOT implementing**: Advanced temporal analysis or trend detection (basic merge functionality)
- **NOT implementing**: Content deduplication beyond timestamp matching (handled by duplicate detection)
- **NOT implementing**: Real-time streaming merge (batch-based approach per PRD)

## Subtasks

- [ ] Design data merge algorithm for timestamp-based combination
- [ ] Implement temporal ordering logic for mixed data sources
- [ ] Handle timezone and timestamp format normalization
- [ ] Create source attribution tracking in merged data
- [ ] Integrate merge logic with existing processing pipeline
- [ ] Add validation for merged data consistency
- [ ] Implement gap minimization between archive and API data
- [ ] Write comprehensive tests for merge accuracy
