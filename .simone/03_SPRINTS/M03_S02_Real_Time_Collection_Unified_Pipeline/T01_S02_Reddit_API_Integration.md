# Task: Reddit API Integration

## Description

Implement Reddit API authentication, rate limiting (100 requests/minute constraint), and cost management within the free tier to enable real-time data collection. This establishes the foundation for ongoing Reddit API collection as outlined in PRD section 5.1.2.

## Goal / Objectives

- Establish secure Reddit API authentication using OAuth2
- Implement rate limiting to stay within 100 requests/minute hard constraint
- Set up cost management and monitoring within free tier limits
- Create reusable Reddit API client for both collection strategies

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Reddit API authentication is functional and secure
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents exceeding 100 requests/minute limit
- [ ] API client handles authentication errors and token refresh
- [ ] Cost monitoring tracks API usage within free tier constraints
- [ ] Integration tests verify API connectivity and rate limiting

## PRD References

**IMPLEMENTS PRD REQUIREMENTS:**

- Section 5.1.2: Ongoing Reddit API Collection - Authentication, rate limiting, cost management
- Section 2.5: External APIs - Reddit API integration specifications

**BROADER CONTEXT:**

- Section 1: Overview & Core System Architecture (all subsections) - System integration context
- Section 2: Technology Stack (all subsections) - External API integration patterns
- Section 3: Hybrid Monorepo & Modular Monolith Architecture (all subsections) - Module structure
- Section 4: Data Model & Database Architecture (all subsections) - Data integration requirements
- Section 9: PRE-MVP Implementation Roadmap (all subsections) - Milestone context and boundaries
- Section 10: POST-MVP Roadmap (all subsections) - Future roadmap and scaling considerations

**SCOPE BOUNDARIES FROM PRD:**

- **NOT implementing**: Advanced caching beyond basic rate limiting (deferred to Post-MVP)
- **NOT implementing**: Query processing or search functionality (deferred to M04)
- **NOT implementing**: Content analysis or LLM processing (handled by existing M02 systems)

## Subtasks

- [ ] Set up Reddit API OAuth2 authentication flow
- [ ] Implement rate limiting middleware (100 requests/minute)
- [ ] Create Reddit API client with error handling and retry logic
- [ ] Add cost monitoring and usage tracking
- [ ] Write integration tests for API connectivity
- [ ] Document API configuration and usage patterns
