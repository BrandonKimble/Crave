# Task: Dual Collection Strategy Implementation

## Description

Implement the dual collection strategy as specified in PRD 5.1.2, focusing on the core chronological collection cycles using `/r/subreddit/new` with dynamic scheduling. Priority scoring for keyword entity search is handled separately to keep complexity manageable.

## Goal / Objectives

- Implement chronological collection cycles with dynamic scheduling
- Develop safety buffer equation for collection frequency calculation  
- Create foundation for keyword entity search integration
- Integrate chronological collection with existing M02 entity processing systems

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Chronological collection fetches recent posts using `/r/subreddit/new`
- [x] Dynamic scheduling calculates collection frequency using safety buffer equation  
- [x] Safety buffer equation properly handles different subreddit posting volumes
- [x] Chronological collection handles error scenarios and retry logic
- [x] Collection strategy tracks last_processed_timestamp correctly
- [x] Integration with existing M02 LLM processing pipeline is functional

## PRD References

**[2025-07-29 21:19]**: Code Review - FAIL
**Result**: FAIL - Critical type errors and ESLint issues prevent deployment
**PRD Compliance**: PASS - Implementation correctly follows PRD Section 5.1.2 dual collection strategy with chronological cycles, dynamic scheduling, safety buffer equation (750_posts / avg_posts_per_day) with 7-60 day constraints, and proper scope boundaries maintained
**Infrastructure Integration**: PASS - Excellent integration with established patterns: uses existing Bull queue system, proper NestJS module structure, integrates with M02 LLM pipeline, follows logging/error handling patterns, and leverages existing RedditService
**Critical Issues**: 
- Type incompatibility in chronological-collection.service.ts line 190: Accessing collectionResult.posts but CollectionMethodResult interface has .data property (severity 9)
- Type mismatch in chronological-collection.processor.ts line 26: nextScheduledCollection declared as Date|null but getEarliestNextCollection returns Date|null which conflicts with Bull interface expectation (severity 9)  
- Type mismatch in chronological-collection.processor.ts line 139: job.retry() method signature incompatible with Bull library (severity 8)
**Major Issues**:
- ESLint errors in shared package: 2 occurrences of prohibited 'any' type in /packages/shared/src/types/index.ts lines 29 and 51 (severity 7)
- Potential runtime errors from type mismatches could cause collection failures (severity 6)
**Recommendations**: 
1. Fix CollectionMethodResult property access: change collectionResult.posts to collectionResult.data in chronological-collection.service.ts
2. Resolve Bull job retry mechanism: remove job.retry() call and rely on throw error for Bull's built-in retry
3. Fix type declaration: change nextScheduledCollection from Date|null to Date|undefined for Bull compatibility
4. Fix shared package ESLint errors: replace 'any' types with proper TypeScript types in shared/src/types/index.ts
5. Complete test coverage with proper mock properties matching actual interfaces
