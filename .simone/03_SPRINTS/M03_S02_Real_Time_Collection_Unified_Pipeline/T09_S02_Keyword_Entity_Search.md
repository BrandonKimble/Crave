# Task: Keyword Entity Search Implementation

## Description

Implement keyword entity search cycles using priority scoring algorithm as specified in PRD 5.1.2. This provides targeted historical enrichment for specific entities through monthly search cycles using `/r/subreddit/search`.

## Goal / Objectives

- Implement keyword entity search using `/r/subreddit/search`
- Create priority scoring algorithm for entity selection
- Develop monthly scheduling system with offset timing
- Select top 20-30 entities monthly based on priority scores

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Keyword entity search uses `/r/subreddit/search?q={entity}&sort=relevance&limit=1000`
- [ ] Priority scoring algorithm considers data recency, quality, and user demand
- [ ] Monthly scheduling system executes with proper offset from chronological collection
- [ ] Top 20-30 entities are selected monthly based on priority scores
- [ ] Multi-entity coverage includes restaurants, dishes, and attributes
- [ ] Integration with existing M02 LLM processing pipeline works correctly

## PRD References

**IMPLEMENTS PRD REQUIREMENTS:**

- Section 5.1.2: Keyword Entity Search Cycles - Monthly targeted enrichment using priority scoring
- Section 5.1.2: Entity Priority - Priority scoring algorithm considering data recency, quality, user demand
- Section 5.1.2: Multi-Entity Coverage - Comprehensive semantic net across entity types

**BROADER CONTEXT:**

- Section 1: Overview & Core System Architecture (all subsections) - Data collection flow architecture
- Section 2: Technology Stack (all subsections) - Background job processing and scheduling
- Section 3: Hybrid Monorepo & Modular Monolith Architecture (all subsections) - Content processing domain
- Section 4: Data Model & Database Architecture (all subsections) - Entity and connection structures
- Section 5: Data Collection Strategy & Architecture (all subsections) - Collection strategy context
- Section 6: Reddit Data Collection Process (all subsections) - Processing pipeline integration
- Section 9: PRE-MVP IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP (all subsections) - Milestone context and boundaries
- Section 10: POST-MVP ROADMAP (all subsections) - Future roadmap and scaling considerations

**SCOPE BOUNDARIES FROM PRD:**

- **NOT implementing**: Advanced machine learning for entity prioritization (basic scoring algorithm)
- **NOT implementing**: Cross-subreddit entity search (single subreddit focus for MVP)
- **NOT implementing**: Real-time entity trend analysis (monthly batch approach per PRD)

## Subtasks

- [ ] Implement keyword search using `/r/subreddit/search` API
- [ ] Create priority scoring algorithm for entity selection
- [ ] Build monthly scheduling system with offset timing
- [ ] Implement top 20-30 entity selection logic
- [ ] Add multi-entity type coverage (restaurants, dishes, attributes)
- [ ] Integrate with existing M02 LLM processing pipeline
- [ ] Add monitoring for search performance and entity coverage
- [ ] Write tests for priority scoring accuracy
