# Task: Unified Processing Integration

## Description

Integrate the new Reddit API data collection with existing M02 LLM processing pipeline to create unified entity extraction for both historical and real-time data sources as specified in PRD sections 5.1.2 and 6.1.

## Goal / Objectives

- Integrate Reddit API data with existing M02 LLM processing pipeline
- Ensure unified entity extraction works for both data sources
- Maintain consistency with existing processing standards
- Complete the six-step unified pipeline from data retrieval to quality score updates

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Reddit API data integrates seamlessly with existing M02 LLM processing
- [ ] Unified entity extraction produces consistent results across data sources
- [ ] Six-step processing pipeline (PRD 6.1) works end-to-end
- [ ] Knowledge graph updates work correctly for API-sourced data
- [ ] Quality score integration triggers properly for new data
- [ ] Processing maintains consistency with S01 historical data processing

## PRD References

**IMPLEMENTS PRD REQUIREMENTS:**

- Section 5.1.2: LLM processing integration - Unified entity extraction for both data sources
- Section 6.1: Six-step unified pipeline - Complete processing from retrieval to score updates
- Section 6.1: Step 3 - LLM Content Processing using existing M02 systems
- Section 6.1: Steps 4-6 - Entity resolution, database updates, and quality score integration
