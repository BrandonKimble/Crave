# Task: Gap Tracking System

## Description

Implement a comprehensive gap tracking system to monitor for missed content and ensure data continuity between historical Pushshift archives (from S01) and real-time Reddit API collection as specified in PRD 5.1.2 and milestone success criteria.

## Goal / Objectives

- Monitor data continuity between historical and real-time sources
- Identify gaps in content collection across time periods
- Report data continuity issues for operational awareness
- Provide foundation for gap mitigation strategies

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] System tracks timestamp coverage between Pushshift archives and Reddit API data
- [ ] Gap detection identifies missing time periods or content areas
- [ ] Reporting provides clear visibility into data continuity status
- [ ] Integration with both collection strategies tracks completeness
- [ ] Monitoring alerts on significant gaps or collection failures
- [ ] Gap data is persisted for historical analysis and trend identification

## PRD References

**IMPLEMENTS PRD REQUIREMENTS:**

- Section 5.1.2: Gap tracking system - Monitor for missed content and data continuity
- Section 9.3.2: Success Criteria - "Gap tracking identifies and reports data continuity issues"
- Section 5.1.2: Gap Minimization Strategy - Bidirectional enrichment and overlap detection

**BROADER CONTEXT:**

- Section 1: Overview & Core System Architecture (all subsections) - System monitoring and reliability
- Section 2: Technology Stack (all subsections) - Monitoring and logging infrastructure
- Section 3: Hybrid Monorepo & Modular Monolith Architecture (all subsections) - Infrastructure domain
- Section 4: Data Model & Database Architecture (all subsections) - Gap tracking data storage
- Section 5: Data Collection Strategy & Architecture (all subsections) - Hybrid approach context
- Section 9: PRE-MVP Implementation Roadmap (all subsections) - Milestone context and boundaries
- Section 10: POST-MVP Roadmap (all subsections) - Future roadmap and scaling considerations

**SCOPE BOUNDARIES FROM PRD:**

- **NOT implementing**: Automatic gap filling mechanisms (basic detection and reporting only)
- **NOT implementing**: Advanced gap prediction algorithms (simple monitoring per PRD)
- **NOT implementing**: Cross-subreddit gap analysis (single subreddit focus for MVP)

## Subtasks

- [x] Design gap tracking data model and storage
- [x] Implement timestamp coverage monitoring between data sources
- [x] Create gap detection algorithms for missing time periods
- [x] Add gap reporting and visualization capabilities
- [x] Integrate gap tracking with collection job monitoring
- [x] Implement alerting for significant data continuity issues
- [x] Add historical gap analysis and trend reporting
- [x] Write tests for gap detection accuracy
