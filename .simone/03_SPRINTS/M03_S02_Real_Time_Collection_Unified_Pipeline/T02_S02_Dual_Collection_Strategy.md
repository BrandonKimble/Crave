# Task: Dual Collection Strategy Implementation

## Description

Implement the dual collection strategy as specified in PRD 5.1.2, focusing on the core chronological collection cycles using `/r/subreddit/new` with dynamic scheduling. Priority scoring for keyword entity search is handled separately to keep complexity manageable.

## Goal / Objectives

- Implement chronological collection cycles with dynamic scheduling
- Develop safety buffer equation for collection frequency calculation  
- Create foundation for keyword entity search integration
- Integrate chronological collection with existing M02 entity processing systems

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Chronological collection fetches recent posts using `/r/subreddit/new`
- [ ] Dynamic scheduling calculates collection frequency using safety buffer equation  
- [ ] Safety buffer equation properly handles different subreddit posting volumes
- [ ] Chronological collection handles error scenarios and retry logic
- [ ] Collection strategy tracks last_processed_timestamp correctly
- [ ] Integration with existing M02 LLM processing pipeline is functional

## PRD References

**IMPLEMENTS PRD REQUIREMENTS:**

- Section 5.1.2: Dual Collection Strategy - Chronological Collection Cycles implementation
- Section 5.1.2: Dynamic Scheduling - Safety buffer equation and frequency calculation  
- Section 5.1.2: Chronological Collection - Complete recent coverage using `/r/subreddit/new`

**BROADER CONTEXT:**

- Section 1: Overview & Core System Architecture (all subsections) - Data collection flow architecture
- Section 2: Technology Stack (all subsections) - Background job processing and scheduling
- Section 3: Hybrid Monorepo & Modular Monolith Architecture (all subsections) - Content processing domain
- Section 4: Data Model & Database Architecture (all subsections) - Entity and connection structures
- Section 6: Reddit Data Collection Process (all subsections) - Processing pipeline integration
- Section 9: PRE-MVP Implementation Roadmap (all subsections) - Milestone context and boundaries
- Section 10: POST-MVP Roadmap (all subsections) - Future roadmap and scaling considerations

**SCOPE BOUNDARIES FROM PRD:**

- **NOT implementing**: On-demand query-driven collection (deferred to M04 when search interface exists)
- **NOT implementing**: Quality score computation algorithms (deferred to M05)
- **NOT implementing**: Advanced scheduling optimization (basic implementation per PRD requirements)

## Subtasks

- [ ] Implement chronological collection using `/r/subreddit/new`
- [ ] Create dynamic scheduling with safety buffer equation
- [ ] Handle different subreddit posting volumes in safety buffer calculation
- [ ] Add error handling and retry logic for chronological collection
- [ ] Integrate chronological collection with existing M02 LLM processing pipeline
- [ ] Track last_processed_timestamp for collection continuity
- [ ] Add monitoring and logging for chronological collection performance
- [ ] Create foundation interfaces for keyword search integration (T09_S02)
