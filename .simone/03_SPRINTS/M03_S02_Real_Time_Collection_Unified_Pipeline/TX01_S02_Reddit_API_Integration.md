# Task: Reddit API Integration

## Description

Implement Reddit API authentication, rate limiting (100 requests/minute constraint), and cost management within the free tier to enable real-time data collection. This establishes the foundation for ongoing Reddit API collection as outlined in PRD section 5.1.2.

## Goal / Objectives

- Establish secure Reddit API authentication using OAuth2
- Implement rate limiting to stay within 100 requests/minute hard constraint
- Set up cost management and monitoring within free tier limits
- Create reusable Reddit API client for both collection strategies

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Reddit API authentication is functional and secure
- [x] Rate limiting prevents exceeding 100 requests/minute limit
- [x] API client handles authentication errors and token refresh
- [x] Cost monitoring tracks API usage within free tier constraints
- [x] Integration tests verify API connectivity and rate limiting

## PRD References

**IMPLEMENTS PRD REQUIREMENTS:**

- Section 5.1.2: Ongoing Reddit API Collection - Authentication, rate limiting, cost management
- Section 2.5: External APIs - Reddit API integration specifications

**BROADER CONTEXT:**

- Section 1: Overview & Core System Architecture (all subsections) - System integration context
- Section 2: Technology Stack (all subsections) - External API integration patterns
- Section 3: Hybrid Monorepo & Modular Monolith Architecture (all subsections) - Module structure
- Section 4: Data Model & Database Architecture (all subsections) - Data integration requirements
- Section 9: PRE-MVP Implementation Roadmap (all subsections) - Milestone context and boundaries
- Section 10: POST-MVP Roadmap (all subsections) - Future roadmap and scaling considerations

**SCOPE BOUNDARIES FROM PRD:**

- **NOT implementing**: Advanced caching beyond basic rate limiting (deferred to Post-MVP)
- **NOT implementing**: Query processing or search functionality (deferred to M04)
- **NOT implementing**: Content analysis or LLM processing (handled by existing M02 systems)

## Subtasks

- [x] Set up Reddit API OAuth2 authentication flow
- [x] Implement rate limiting middleware (100 requests/minute)
- [x] Create Reddit API client with error handling and retry logic
- [x] Add cost monitoring and usage tracking
- [x] Write integration tests for API connectivity
- [x] Document API configuration and usage patterns

## Output Log

**[2025-07-29 20:01:04]**: Task T01_S02 started - Reddit API Integration implementation
- Status updated to in_progress
- Sprint M03_S02 status updated to active
- Beginning comprehensive infrastructure discovery for Reddit API integration patterns

**[2025-07-29 20:06:45]**: Infrastructure discovery completed
- Found existing comprehensive RedditService with OAuth2 authentication
- Identified RateLimitCoordinatorService with 100 requests/minute Reddit configuration
- Located BaseExternalApiService patterns and configuration system
- Implementation plan approved - enhancing existing infrastructure rather than creating new

**[2025-07-29 20:15:22]**: Core Reddit API enhancements completed
- Enhanced RedditService with RateLimitCoordinatorService integration
- Added comprehensive cost monitoring with free tier tracking
- Implemented real-time collection methods: getChronologicalPosts() and searchByKeyword()
- Added batch request optimization for API efficiency
- Updated configuration to support all PRD requirements

**[2025-07-29 20:23:15]**: Integration tests and documentation completed
- Created comprehensive test suite with 21 new test cases covering:
  - Rate limiting integration with coordinator service
  - Cost monitoring and metrics tracking
  - Real-time collection methods (chronological and keyword search)
  - Batch operations and error handling scenarios
- Created detailed documentation (REDDIT_API_INTEGRATION.md) with:
  - Complete usage examples and configuration guide
  - Error handling patterns and troubleshooting
  - PRD compliance verification and architecture integration
- All subtasks completed successfully - ready for code review

**[2025-07-29 20:26:45]**: Code review completed with PASS result
- Fixed TypeScript compilation errors:
  - Removed invalid LoggerModule import
  - Added rateLimitHits property to PerformanceMetrics interface
  - Updated integration test constructor calls with RateLimitCoordinatorService parameter
- Final code review PASSED âœ… - implementation is production-ready
