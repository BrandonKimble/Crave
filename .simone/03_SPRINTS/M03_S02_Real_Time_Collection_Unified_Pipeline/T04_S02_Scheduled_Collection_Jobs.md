# Task: Scheduled Collection Jobs

## Description

Implement reliable scheduled collection jobs for both chronological and keyword entity search cycles with comprehensive error handling and retry logic as specified in PRD 5.1.2. This provides automated, resilient data collection that maintains consistency without manual intervention.

## Goal / Objectives

- Create robust scheduling system for both collection strategies
- Implement comprehensive error handling and retry mechanisms
- Add monitoring and alerting for collection job failures
- Ensure jobs integrate seamlessly with existing infrastructure

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Chronological collection jobs run on dynamic schedule based on subreddit activity
- [ ] Keyword entity search jobs execute monthly with proper offset timing
- [ ] Error handling gracefully manages API failures, rate limits, and network issues
- [ ] Retry logic implements exponential backoff for failed requests
- [ ] Job monitoring tracks success rates and failure patterns
- [ ] Jobs persist state and can resume after interruptions

## PRD References

**IMPLEMENTS PRD REQUIREMENTS:**

- Section 5.1.2: Scheduled collection jobs - Daily/hourly updates with error handling and retry logic
- Section 5.1.2: Dynamic Scheduling - Collection frequency based on posting volume
- Section 5.1.2: Monthly offset scheduling - Keyword entity search timing

**BROADER CONTEXT:**

- Section 1: Overview & Core System Architecture (all subsections) - Background processing architecture
- Section 2: Technology Stack (all subsections) - @nestjs/bull for background jobs and scheduling
- Section 3: Hybrid Monorepo & Modular Monolith Architecture (all subsections) - Infrastructure domain
- Section 4: Data Model & Database Architecture (all subsections) - Job state persistence
- Section 5: Data Collection Strategy & Architecture (all subsections) - Collection strategy context
- Section 9: PRE-MVP IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP (all subsections) - Milestone context and boundaries
- Section 10: POST-MVP ROADMAP (all subsections) - Future roadmap and scaling considerations

**SCOPE BOUNDARIES FROM PRD:**

- **NOT implementing**: Advanced scheduling optimization beyond dynamic frequency calculation
- **NOT implementing**: Machine learning-based failure prediction (basic retry logic per PRD)
- **NOT implementing**: Cross-subreddit coordination optimization (future enhancement)

## Subtasks

- [ ] Set up job scheduling infrastructure using @nestjs/bull
- [ ] Implement dynamic scheduling for chronological collection
- [ ] Create monthly scheduling for keyword entity search with offset timing
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling for API failures and rate limits
- [ ] Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- [ ] Create job state persistence and resume capability
- [ ] Add monitoring and alerting for job failures
- [ ] Write integration tests for job reliability
