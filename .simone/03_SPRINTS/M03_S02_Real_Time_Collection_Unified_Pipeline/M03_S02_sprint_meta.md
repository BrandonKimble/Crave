# Sprint: Real-Time Collection & Unified Pipeline (S02)

## Sprint Goal

**PRD-ALIGNED OBJECTIVE:** Implement Reddit API integration with dual collection strategy, unified processing pipeline for both historical and real-time data sources, and comprehensive gap tracking system.

## Scope & Key Deliverables

**IMPLEMENTS PRD SECTIONS:** [1, 2, 3, 4, 5.1.2, 6.1, 9.3, 10]

**Real-Time Data Collection (Reddit API) - PRD 5.1.2:**

- **Reddit API integration**: Authentication, rate limiting (100 requests/minute constraint), cost management within free tier
- **Content retrieval pipeline**: Post/comment fetching with URL storage, complete thread retrieval, API usage optimization through batching
- **Scheduled collection jobs**: Implement dual collection strategy with error handling and retry logic:
  - **Chronological Collection Cycles**: `/r/subreddit/new` with dynamic scheduling based on posting volume
  - **Keyword Entity Search Cycles**: Monthly targeted enrichment using priority scoring algorithm
- **Gap tracking system**: Monitor for missed content and data continuity between historical and real-time sources

**Unified Processing Pipeline - PRD 6.1:**

- **Data merge logic**: Combine historical (from S01) and real-time data by timestamp to prevent gaps
- **Duplicate detection**: Prevent duplicate processing of overlapping content between Pushshift archives and Reddit API
- **LLM processing integration**: Unified entity extraction for both data sources using existing M02 LLM pipeline

**Processing Integration - PRD 6.1:**

- **Six-step unified pipeline**: From data retrieval to quality score updates
- **Knowledge graph updates**: Create entities, connections, and mentions using existing M02 systems
- **Quality score integration**: Trigger score updates for affected entities using existing M02 infrastructure

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)

**DERIVED FROM PRD SUCCESS CRITERIA (9.3.2):**

- Reddit API authentication and basic data retrieval functional
- Scheduled collection jobs run reliably with proper error handling using dual collection strategy
- Data merge logic correctly handles overlapping content between historical and real-time sources
- LLM processing pipeline extracts entities from both data sources using unified approach
- Combined dataset provides comprehensive coverage (historical + real-time)
- Gap tracking identifies and reports data continuity issues
- Duplicate detection prevents duplicate processing across data sources
- Unified processing pipeline integrates seamlessly with existing M02 LLM and entity resolution systems

## Scope Boundaries

**ENFORCED FROM PRD ROADMAP:**

- **NOT included**: Dynamic Query System (deferred to M04 - PRD section 9.4)
- **NOT included**: Basic Ranking & Scoring algorithms (deferred to M05 - PRD section 9.5)
- **NOT included**: Complex multi-attribute queries (deferred to M06 - PRD section 9.6)
- **NOT included**: Basic Search Interface + Mobile App (deferred to M07 - PRD section 9.7)
- **NOT included**: Evidence & Attribution System (deferred to M08 - PRD section 9.8)
- **NOT included**: Advanced caching beyond basic implementation (deferred to Post-MVP milestones)
- **Boundary**: Tasks implement ONLY [1, 2, 3, 4, 5.1.2, 6.1, 9.3, 10] requirements

## Technical Context

**From PRD 5.1.2 Implementation Details:**

**Dual Collection Strategy:**
- **Chronological Collection**: Safety buffer equation `safe_interval = (750_posts / avg_posts_per_day)`, 7-60 day constraints
- **Keyword Entity Search**: Top 20-30 entities monthly, priority scoring based on data recency, quality, and user demand
- **Gap Minimization**: Bidirectional enrichment, parallel processing with historical data

**Reddit API Constraints:**
- **Rate Limit**: 100 requests/minute (hard constraint)
- **Cost**: $0 within rate limits (minimal cost for daily updates)
- **Search Limit**: 1000 posts per query (manageable for daily updates)

**Dependencies:**
- Requires S01_M03 Historical Data Foundation (provides historical data source)
- Requires M01 Database Foundation (✅ COMPLETED)
- Requires M02 Entity Processing Core & External Integrations (✅ COMPLETED - provides LLM integration and entity resolution)
- Completes M03 milestone DoD enabling M04 Dynamic Query System
