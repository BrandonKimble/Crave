# Task: Content Retrieval Pipeline

## Description

Implement the content retrieval pipeline for Reddit API data collection, including post/comment fetching with URL storage, complete thread retrieval, and API usage optimization through batching as specified in PRD sections 5.1.2 and 6.1.

## Goal / Objectives

- Create efficient post and comment fetching mechanisms
- Implement complete thread retrieval for comprehensive context
- Store post/comment IDs and URLs for direct access and attribution
- Optimize API usage through intelligent batching strategies

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Pipeline fetches complete posts and comment threads from Reddit API
- [ ] All post/comment IDs and URLs are stored for attribution
- [ ] Batching optimization reduces API calls while maintaining data completeness
- [ ] Thread retrieval captures hierarchical comment relationships
- [ ] Pipeline integrates with rate limiting from T01_S02
- [ ] Content is properly structured for LLM processing integration

## PRD References

**IMPLEMENTS PRD REQUIREMENTS:**

- Section 5.1.2: Content retrieval pipeline - Post/comment fetching, URL storage, complete thread retrieval
- Section 6.1: Step 2b - Reddit API Collection with batching optimization
- Section 6.3.1: LLM Input Structure - Hierarchical post-comment relationships

**BROADER CONTEXT:**

- Section 1: Overview & Core System Architecture (all subsections) - Data collection flow
- Section 2: Technology Stack (all subsections) - API integration and data processing
- Section 3: Hybrid Monorepo & Modular Monolith Architecture (all subsections) - Content processing module
- Section 4: Data Model & Database Architecture (all subsections) - Data storage requirements
- Section 5: Data Collection Strategy & Architecture (all subsections) - Collection strategy context
- Section 6: Reddit Data Collection Process (all subsections) - Processing pipeline context
- Section 9: PRE-MVP IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP (all subsections) - Milestone context and boundaries
- Section 10: POST-MVP ROADMAP (all subsections) - Future roadmap and scaling considerations

**SCOPE BOUNDARIES FROM PRD:**

- **NOT implementing**: Content analysis or entity extraction (handled by existing M02 LLM systems)
- **NOT implementing**: Advanced optimization beyond batching (basic implementation per PRD)
- **NOT implementing**: Search result processing (deferred to M04 search interface)

## Subtasks

- [x] Implement post fetching with complete metadata
- [x] Create comment thread retrieval with hierarchical structure
- [x] Add URL storage and ID tracking for attribution
- [x] Implement batching optimization for API efficiency
- [x] Integrate with T01_S02 rate limiting system
- [x] Structure content for LLM processing pipeline
- [x] Add error handling for incomplete or deleted content
- [x] Create monitoring for retrieval performance and success rates

## Output Log
