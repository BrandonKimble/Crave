# Task: Entities Repository Layer - Basic CRUD Foundation

## Description

Implement basic CRUD operations for the entities table supporting all entity types (restaurant, dish_or_category, dish_attribute, restaurant_attribute). This task focuses on fundamental data access operations without complex business logic or advanced querying features.

The entities table serves as unified storage for all entity types, differentiated by the `entity_type` enum. This repository implementation provides essential database operations for creating, reading, updating, and deleting entities with basic validation.

## Goal / Objectives

Establish basic data access patterns for the unified entities table as part of the database foundation setup.

- Implement basic CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) for all entity types
- Provide type-safe database operations using Prisma generated types
- Handle basic entity-specific field requirements
- Enable foundation for higher-level service operations

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] EntitiesRepository class implements basic CRUD operations (create, findById, findMany, update, delete)
- [x] Support for all entity types: restaurant, dish_or_category, dish_attribute, restaurant_attribute
- [x] Type-safe entity creation and updates with basic field validation
- [x] Simple query methods support filtering by entity type and basic fields
- [x] Basic error handling with database constraint violations
- [x] Integration with PrismaService using dependency injection
- [x] Repository follows NestJS patterns and exports properly

## Dependencies

- **T01_S02**: Repository Layer Foundation - Requires base repository infrastructure and patterns
- **T02_S02**: Database Configuration & Connection Pooling - Requires optimized database connection setup
- **T03_S02**: Error Handling & Validation - Requires error handling infrastructure for database operations
- **T04_S02**: Logging Infrastructure - Requires logging setup for repository operations

## PRD References

- Section 4.1: Graph-based entity model architecture
- Section 4.1.1: Entity table structure and unified storage
- Section 4.1.2: Entity type differentiation and field usage
- Section 2.7: Development tools and NestJS patterns

## Technical Guidance

**Entity Table Schema Usage:**
- Entity model uses unified storage with `entity_type` enum for differentiation
- Restaurant entities utilize location fields (latitude, longitude, address, googlePlaceId)
- Restaurant entities have quality scoring (restaurantQualityScore) and metadata storage
- All entity types support aliases array for name variations
- Restaurant entities use restaurantAttributes array for UUID references

**Entity Type Requirements:**
- `restaurant`: Basic restaurant data with essential fields
- `dish_or_category`: Name and description - basic field requirements
- `dish_attribute`: Connection-scoped descriptors with minimal fields
- `restaurant_attribute`: Restaurant-scoped descriptors with minimal fields

**Repository Design Patterns:**
- Extend BaseRepository if available, otherwise implement standard repository interface
- Use Prisma client through dependency injection
- Implement basic CRUD operations for all entity types
- Support basic updates with essential data integrity

## Implementation Notes

**CRUD Operation Implementation:**
- Create methods validate basic required fields per entity type
- Read operations support simple queries and filtering
- Update methods handle basic updates with essential validation
- Delete operations consider basic data integrity constraints

**Type Safety and Validation:**
- Use Prisma generated types for strict typing
- Implement basic runtime validation for entity type constraints
- Handle essential fields based on entity type requirements
- Basic error handling for constraint violations

## Subtasks

- [x] Create entities.repository.ts in `/repositories/` directory
- [x] Implement BaseRepository interface (create, findById, findMany, update, delete)
- [x] Add basic entity type-specific create methods with essential field validation
- [x] Implement basic find methods with entity type filtering
- [x] Implement basic update operations with essential validation
- [x] Add basic delete operations with constraint handling
- [x] Create basic entity type guard functions for runtime validation
- [x] Add basic error handling and logging
- [x] Test basic CRUD operations with different entity types

## Output Log
