# Sprint: Database Schema Foundation - Complete Schema Implementation (S01)

## Sprint Goal

Implement the complete database schema with all tables, indexes, constraints, and migrations to establish the foundational data layer.

## Scope & Key Deliverables

- **Complete Prisma schema** with all core tables (entities, connections, mentions, users)
- **All required indexes** for performance optimization as specified in PRD
- **Enum types and constraints** properly defined (entity_type, activity_level, etc.)
- **Foreign key relationships** properly enforced across all tables
- **Database migrations** created and tested with Prisma
- **Basic seed data** for development and testing purposes
- **Schema validation** to ensure all requirements are met

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)

- ✅ Prisma schema file contains all required tables matching PRD specification
- ✅ All indexes and constraints are properly defined
- ✅ Database migrations successfully create schema in PostgreSQL
- ✅ Seed data populates basic test entities for development
- ✅ Schema validation confirms all foreign key relationships work
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing infrastructure

## Sprint Tasks

### Implementation Tasks (Sequential Order)

1. **T01: Core Database Schema Implementation** - `T01_S01_Core_Database_Schema_Implementation.md`

   - Implement unified entities table, connections table, mentions table, and user management tables
   - Define all enum types (entity_type, activity_level, subscription_status, mention_source)
   - Complexity: Medium

2. **T02: Database Indexes and Performance Optimization** - `T02_S01_Database_Indexes_Performance_Optimization.md`

   - Implement all 20+ required indexes from PRD specification
   - Set up spatial and text search indexes for performance optimization
   - Complexity: Medium

3. **T03: Database Constraints and Relationships** - `T03_S01_Database_Constraints_Relationships.md`

   - Implement foreign key relationships, unique constraints, and data validation rules
   - Ensure referential integrity across all tables
   - Complexity: Medium

4. **T04: Prisma Migrations and Schema Management** - `T04_S01_Prisma_Migrations_Schema_Management.md`

   - Create and test Prisma migrations for complete schema deployment
   - Validate migration system across environments
   - Complexity: Medium

5. **T05: Seed Data and Schema Validation** - `T05_S01_Seed_Data_Schema_Validation.md`
   - Create comprehensive seed data for all entity types
   - Implement schema validation and integrity testing
   - Complexity: Medium

## Notes / Retrospective Points

This sprint focuses purely on the database schema layer - no business logic or application code. The goal is to create a solid foundation that exactly matches the PRD specifications for the graph-based entity model. All subsequent development depends on this schema being correct and complete.

**Task Dependencies**: Tasks must be completed in sequential order (T01 → T02 → T03 → T04 → T05) as each builds upon the previous work.
