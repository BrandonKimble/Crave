# Task: Archive Download and Storage Setup

## Description

Set up the foundational infrastructure for Pushshift archive processing by establishing proper storage structure and downloading the target subreddit archive files. This task creates the basic file system structure and ensures the required zstd-compressed archive files are accessible for processing.

## Goal / Objectives

Establish the complete storage infrastructure and file access for historical Reddit data processing from Pushshift archives.

- Set up proper directory structure at apps/api/data/pushshift/ for archive storage
- Ensure target subreddit archive files (r/austinfood, r/FoodNYC) are available for processing
- Validate file integrity and accessibility for subsequent stream processing tasks
- Document storage layout and file organization for team reference

## Acceptance Criteria

Specific, measurable conditions that must be met for this task to be considered 'done'.

- [x] Directory structure apps/api/data/pushshift/ is created and properly organized
- [x] Target archive files are confirmed present: austinfood_comments.zst, austinfood_submissions.zst, FoodNYC_comments.zst, FoodNYC_submissions.zst
- [x] File integrity is verified (files are valid zstd-compressed ndjson format)
- [x] Storage documentation is created explaining directory structure and file organization
- [x] Local development environment has proper access permissions to archive files
- [x] Foundation for S3 production storage strategy is documented

## PRD References

**IMPLEMENTS PRD REQUIREMENTS:**

- Section 5.1.1: Initial Historical Load (Primary Foundation) - Archive download via torrent, local storage setup at apps/api/data/pushshift/
- Section 6.1: Processing Pipeline - Data source selection and content scope definition
- Section 9.3: Milestone 3 Hybrid Data Collection Implementation - Archive download and setup requirements

**BROADER CONTEXT:**

- Section 1: Overview & Core System Architecture (all subsections) - System architecture context
- Section 2: Technology Stack (all subsections) - Technical infrastructure requirements  
- Section 3: Hybrid Monorepo & Modular Monolith Architecture (all subsections) - Project structure context
- Section 4: Data Model & Database Architecture (all subsections) - Data architecture context
- Section 5: Data Collection Strategy & Architecture (all subsections) - Data collection framework context
- Section 6: Reddit Data Collection Process (all subsections) - Processing pipeline context
- Section 9: PRE-MVP Implementation Roadmap (all subsections) - Milestone context and boundaries
- Section 10: POST-MVP Roadmap (all subsections) - Future roadmap and scaling considerations

**SCOPE BOUNDARIES FROM PRD:**

- **NOT implementing**: Actual torrent download process (archives already present)
- **NOT implementing**: zstd decompression functionality (deferred to T02_S01)
- **NOT implementing**: Stream processing implementation (deferred to T02_S01)
- **NOT implementing**: Reddit API integration (deferred to M03_S02 - PRD section 5.1.2)
- **NOT implementing**: LLM processing pipeline (uses existing M02 integration)

## Subtasks

A checklist of smaller steps to complete this task.

- [x] Verify apps/api/data/pushshift/ directory structure exists and is properly organized
- [x] Confirm presence of all required archive files (4 files total: 2 subreddits × 2 file types)
- [x] Test file accessibility and permissions for Node.js processing
- [x] Validate archive file format and basic integrity
- [x] Document storage layout and file organization structure
- [x] Create basic configuration for file paths and subreddit targeting
- [x] Document S3 production storage preparation strategy
