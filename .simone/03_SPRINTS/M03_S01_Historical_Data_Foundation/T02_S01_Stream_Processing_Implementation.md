# Task: Stream Processing Implementation (zstd + ndjson)

## Description

Implement the core stream processing system for handling zstd-compressed ndjson archive files without loading entire files into memory. This task creates the technical foundation for processing massive Pushshift archive files efficiently using Node.js readline interface and zstd decompression.

## Goal / Objectives

Create a memory-efficient streaming system that can process large zstd-compressed ndjson files line-by-line without performance issues.

- Implement zstd decompression streaming using Node.js zstd libraries
- Create ndjson line-by-line parsing using Node.js readline interface
- Establish memory-efficient processing pipeline that handles large files without exhaustion
- Create reusable streaming components for both comments and submissions file types
- Validate processing performance with realistic file sizes

## Acceptance Criteria

Specific, measurable conditions that must be met for this task to be considered 'done'.

- [ ] zstd decompression streaming is implemented and functional
- [ ] Node.js readline interface successfully parses ndjson line-by-line
- [ ] Stream processing handles large files without memory issues or performance degradation
- [ ] Processing pipeline can handle both comments and submissions file formats
- [ ] Error handling and recovery mechanisms are implemented for stream failures
- [ ] Basic performance metrics are captured (processing speed, memory usage)
- [ ] Streaming components are reusable for different sureddit archive files
