# Task: LLM Processing Integration Preparation

## Description

Prepare the data structure formatting and integration points to ensure seamless connection between historical archive processing and the existing M02 LLM processing pipeline. This task focuses on data structure compatibility and integration readiness without implementing LLM processing itself.

## Goal / Objectives

Ensure extracted historical data can seamlessly integrate with existing M02 LLM entity extraction pipeline.

- Format extracted historical data to match existing M02 LLM input requirements
- Create integration adapters between historical processing and existing LLM pipeline
- Validate data structure compatibility with existing entity resolution systems
- Prepare configuration for historical data processing through existing LLM infrastructure
- Test integration points without executing full LLM processing

## Acceptance Criteria

Specific, measurable conditions that must be met for this task to be considered 'done'.

- [ ] Extracted historical data matches format expected by existing M02 LLM pipeline
- [ ] Integration adapters successfully connect historical processing to LLM systems
- [ ] Data structure validation confirms compatibility with existing entity resolution
- [ ] Configuration enables routing historical data through existing M02 infrastructure
- [ ] Integration testing validates data flow without executing expensive LLM processing
- [ ] Documentation explains integration approach and data flow architecture

- **NOT implementing**: Quality score computation (uses existing M02 systems)

## Subtasks

A checklist of smaller steps to complete this task.

- [ ] Review existing M02 LLM pipeline input/output data structures
- [ ] Design data structure formatters for historical archive data to match LLM requirements
- [ ] Create integration adapters that connect historical processing to existing LLM systems
- [ ] Implement configuration system for routing historical data through existing infrastructure
- [ ] Build validation system to ensure data structure compatibility
- [ ] Test integration points with sample data (without full LLM execution)
- [ ] Document integration architecture and data flow design
- [ ] Create error handling for integration failures and data format mismatches
