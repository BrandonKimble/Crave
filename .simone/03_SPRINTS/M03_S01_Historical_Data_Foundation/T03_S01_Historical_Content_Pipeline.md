# Task: Historical Content Pipeline (Post/Comment Extraction)

## Description

Build the content extraction pipeline that processes individual Reddit posts and comments from the streaming ndjson data, extracting relevant fields and preparing structured data with proper timestamp processing for comprehensive historical context through end-2024.

## Goal / Objectives

Create a robust content extraction system that transforms raw Reddit archive data into structured format suitable for LLM processing.

- Extract posts and comments from ndjson stream with all relevant fields
- Implement proper timestamp processing and validation for historical context
- Structure extracted data for seamless integration with existing M02 LLM pipeline  
- Handle different post and comment data structures from Pushshift archives
- Ensure complete historical coverage through end-2024 without data loss

## Acceptance Criteria

Specific, measurable conditions that must be met for this task to be considered 'done'.

- [ ] Post extraction successfully captures all relevant fields (title, body, author, timestamp, subreddit, etc.)
- [ ] Comment extraction successfully captures all relevant fields (body, author, timestamp, parent_id, etc.)
- [ ] Timestamp processing correctly handles Reddit timestamp formats and validates historical coverage
- [ ] Extracted data structure is compatible with existing M02 LLM processing pipeline
- [ ] Content pipeline handles both submissions and comments file formats properly
- [ ] Data validation ensures completeness and catches malformed entries
- [ ] Historical context preservation maintains thread relationships and chronological order

**SCOPE BOUNDARIES FROM PRD:**

- **NOT implementing**: LLM processing execution (uses existing M02 integration, data preparation only)
- **NOT implementing**: Entity resolution or database storage (deferred to M03_S02 unified pipeline)
- **NOT implementing**: Reddit API integration (deferred to M03_S02 - PRD section 5.1.2)
- **NOT implementing**: Data merge logic with real-time sources (deferred to M03_S02)
- **NOT implementing**: Quality score computation (deferred to existing M02 systems)

## Subtasks

A checklist of smaller steps to complete this task.

- [ ] Define data extraction schema for Reddit posts (submissions) from Pushshift format
- [ ] Define data extraction schema for Reddit comments from Pushshift format
- [ ] Implement post extraction logic with field validation and error handling
- [ ] Implement comment extraction logic with field validation and error handling
- [ ] Create timestamp processing and validation system for historical accuracy
- [ ] Build data structure formatting compatible with existing M02 LLM pipeline
- [ ] Implement thread relationship preservation (parent-child comment relationships)
- [ ] Add data validation and quality checks for extracted content
- [ ] Test content pipeline with sample archive data to ensure complete extraction
- [ ] Create logging and monitoring for content extraction progress and issues
