# Sprint: Historical Data Foundation (Pushshift Archives) (S01)

## Sprint Goal

**PRD-ALIGNED OBJECTIVE:** Implement Pushshift archive processing system for comprehensive historical Reddit data collection with stream processing capabilities for memory-efficient handling of large datasets.

## Scope & Key Deliverables

**IMPLEMENTS PRD SECTIONS:** [1, 2, 3, 4, 5.1.1, 6.1, 9.3, 10]

**Historical Data Processing (Pushshift Archives) - PRD 5.1.1:**

- **Archive download and setup**: Download target subreddit files via torrent (qBittorrent recommended), setup local storage at apps/api/data/pushshift/
- **Stream processing implementation**: Implement zstd decompression and ndjson parsing using Node.js readline interface for line-by-line processing
- **Historical content pipeline**: Extract posts/comments from archives with timestamp processing for comprehensive historical context through end-2024
- **Batch processing system**: Handle large datasets efficiently without memory issues using streaming approach, avoiding loading entire files into memory

**Integration Components - PRD 6.1:**

- **Data structure preparation**: Format extracted posts/comments for unified processing pipeline
- **LLM processing preparation**: Structure historical data for entity extraction using existing M02 LLM integration
- **Storage management**: Local development storage setup, preparation for S3 production storage

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)

**DERIVED FROM PRD SUCCESS CRITERIA (9.3.2):**

- Successfully download and process sample Pushshift archive files
- Archive processing handles large files without memory or performance issues
- Historical content pipeline extracts posts/comments with proper timestamp processing
- Stream processing implementation efficiently processes large datasets without memory exhaustion
- Batch processing system demonstrates ability to handle realistic dataset sizes
- Data structure preparation enables seamless integration with existing M02 LLM pipeline
- Storage management supports both local development and preparation for production scaling

## Scope Boundaries

**ENFORCED FROM PRD ROADMAP:**

- **NOT included**: Reddit API integration (deferred to S02_M03 - PRD section 5.1.2)
- **NOT included**: Real-time data collection (deferred to S02_M03)
- **NOT included**: Data merge logic between historical and real-time sources (deferred to S02_M03)
- **NOT included**: Duplicate detection across data sources (deferred to S02_M03)
- **NOT included**: Dynamic Query System (deferred to M04 - PRD section 9.4)
- **NOT included**: Basic Ranking & Scoring (deferred to M05 - PRD section 9.5)
- **Boundary**: Tasks implement ONLY [1, 2, 3, 4, 5.1.1, 6.1, 9.3, 10] requirements

## Technical Context

**From PRD 5.1.1 Implementation Details:**

- **Data Source**: Pushshift archives via Academic Torrents
- **Format**: zstd-compressed ndjson files (one JSON object per line)
- **Target Subreddits**: r/austinfood (primary), r/FoodNYC
- **Processing Method**: Stream processing line-by-line to handle large files without memory issues
- **Coverage**: Complete historical data through end-2024 without 1000-item limitations
- **Storage**: Local development (apps/api/data/pushshift/), S3 for production

**Dependencies:**
- Requires M01 Database Foundation (✅ COMPLETED)
- Requires M02 Entity Processing Core & External Integrations (✅ COMPLETED)
- Sets foundation for S02_M03 Real-Time Collection & Unified Pipeline
