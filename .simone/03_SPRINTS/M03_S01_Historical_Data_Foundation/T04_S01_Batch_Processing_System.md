# Task: Batch Processing System (Memory-Efficient Large Dataset Handling)

## Description

Implement a sophisticated batch processing system that efficiently handles large datasets from Pushshift archives without memory exhaustion. This system coordinates the streaming, extraction, and processing components to handle realistic dataset sizes while maintaining performance and reliability.

## Goal / Objectives

Create a production-ready batch processing system that can handle massive historical datasets efficiently and reliably.

- Implement batch coordination system that manages memory usage across processing pipeline
- Create configurable batch sizes and processing controls for different dataset volumes
- Establish progress tracking and resumption capabilities for long-running processing jobs
- Implement resource monitoring and automatic memory management
- Design system to handle realistic archive file sizes without performance degradation

## Acceptance Criteria

Specific, measurable conditions that must be met for this task to be considered 'done'.

- [ ] Batch processing system successfully processes large archive files without memory exhaustion
- [ ] Configurable batch sizes allow tuning for different system resources and file sizes
- [ ] Progress tracking provides accurate status updates for long-running processing jobs
- [ ] Processing can be resumed from checkpoint in case of interruption or failure
- [ ] Resource monitoring prevents memory overload and maintains system stability
- [ ] System demonstrates ability to handle realistic Pushshift archive file sizes
- [ ] Error handling ensures graceful degradation and recovery from processing failures
