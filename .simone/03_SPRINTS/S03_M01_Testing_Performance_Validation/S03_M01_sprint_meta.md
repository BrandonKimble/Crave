# Sprint: Testing & Performance Validation - Quality Assurance Foundation (S03)

## Sprint Goal

**PRD-ALIGNED OBJECTIVE:** Establish comprehensive testing infrastructure with unit and integration test coverage for database operations to validate M01 foundation quality.

## Scope & Key Deliverables

**IMPLEMENTS PRD SECTIONS:** [9.1.2] Testing Infrastructure and Success Criteria

- **Comprehensive unit test coverage** for all repository layer database operations
- **Integration tests** for service-repository layer interactions with real database
- **Testing infrastructure** with proper database isolation and cleanup patterns
- **Quality validation** ensuring test suite runs successfully as required by M01 DoD
- **Performance baseline** establishment for database operations

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)

**DERIVED FROM PRD SUCCESS CRITERIA:**

- ✅ Test suite runs successfully with comprehensive code coverage for database operations (M01 Success Criteria)
- ✅ Unit tests cover all critical repository classes (BaseRepository, EntityRepository, ConnectionRepository)
- ✅ Integration tests validate service-repository interactions with real database operations
- ✅ Testing infrastructure supports independent test execution without interference
- ✅ Database operations testing validates schema correctness and constraint enforcement

## Scope Boundaries

**ENFORCED FROM PRD ROADMAP:**

- **NOT included**: Performance optimization (deferred to later milestones)
- **NOT included**: Load testing or stress testing (not required by M01)
- **NOT included**: End-to-end application testing (deferred to future milestones)
- **Boundary**: Tasks implement ONLY 9.1.2 testing requirements for database foundation

## Sprint Tasks

### Testing Infrastructure (Sequential Order)

1. **TX01_S03: Unit Test Coverage Database Operations** - Status: Completed ✅
   - Comprehensive unit tests for repository layer (BaseRepository, EntityRepository, ConnectionRepository)
   - Entity validation and error handling test coverage
   - Complexity: High

2. **TX02_S03: Integration Tests Repository Service Layer** - Status: Completed ✅
   - Integration tests for service-repository interactions with real database
   - Transaction testing, error propagation, and cross-service coordination
   - Complexity: High

## Notes / Retrospective Points

This sprint validates the database foundation created in S01-S02 through comprehensive testing. The focus is on ensuring reliability and maintainability of database operations before moving to milestone completion. Testing patterns established here provide templates for future development.

**Task Dependencies**: TX01_S03 provides foundation patterns that TX02_S03 builds upon for integration testing.

**Quality Status**: Both tasks completed with comprehensive test coverage, though some linting issues remain to be addressed in final milestone cleanup.
