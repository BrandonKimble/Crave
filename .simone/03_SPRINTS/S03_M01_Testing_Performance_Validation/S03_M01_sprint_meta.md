# Sprint: Testing & Performance Validation - Quality Assurance & Optimization (S03)

## Sprint Goal

Achieve comprehensive test coverage (>80%) and implement performance validation including bulk operations to complete the milestone.

## Scope & Key Deliverables

- **Comprehensive test suite** with >80% code coverage for database operations
- **Integration tests** for all repository and service layer operations
- **Bulk insert operations** implementation and performance validation
- **Performance benchmarks** for database operations
- **End-to-end testing** of complete database workflows
- **Documentation validation** ensuring all DoD criteria are met
- **Final milestone validation** and sign-off

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)

- ✅ Test suite achieves >80% code coverage for database operations
- ✅ All CRUD operations have comprehensive unit and integration tests
- ✅ Bulk insert operations are implemented and perform within targets
- ✅ Performance validation confirms database operation speed requirements
- ✅ Integration tests validate complete workflows end-to-end
- ✅ All milestone Definition of Done criteria are verified and documented
- ✅ Database layer is production-ready with quality assurance

## Sprint Tasks

### Final Task List (After Roadmap Audit)

1. **T01_S03 - Unit Test Coverage Database Operations** (Complexity: High)
   - Achieve >80% code coverage for all database CRUD operations
   - Comprehensive unit tests for all repository classes and entity types

2. **T02_S03 - Integration Tests Repository Service Layer** (Complexity: High)
   - Integration tests covering service-repository-database interactions
   - Validate dependency injection and transaction boundaries

3. **T03_S03 - Basic Performance Testing Setup** (Complexity: Medium)
   - Basic database benchmark utilities for functional validation
   - Simple performance validation for CRUD and bulk operations

4. **T04_S03 - Bulk Operations Implementation** (Complexity: High)
   - Implement production-ready bulk insert/update operations
   - Performance validation meeting PRD targets (<2s for 100 entity batch)

5. **T05_S03 - End-to-End Database Workflows** (Complexity: High)
   - E2E tests for complete database workflows and transactions
   - Validate entity resolution, connection creation, mention processing

6. **T06_S03 - Milestone Validation Documentation** (Complexity: Medium)
   - Final validation of all M01 DoD criteria and completion documentation
   - Production readiness assessment and milestone sign-off

### Roadmap Audit Summary

- **Deferred 1 task to M05**: T05_Database_Performance_Benchmarks (comprehensive performance testing belongs in M05 Basic Ranking & Scoring)
- **Reduced scope on 1 task**: T03_Performance_Testing_Infrastructure (kept basic setup only, deferred comprehensive testing to M05)  
- **Tasks properly aligned with M01 milestone**: All remaining tasks focus on database foundation validation and testing infrastructure

## Notes / Retrospective Points

This sprint completes the milestone by ensuring everything is properly tested and performs within requirements. Focus is on quality assurance, basic performance validation, and final validation that all milestone objectives are met. Upon completion, the database foundation will be ready to support all future development phases.
