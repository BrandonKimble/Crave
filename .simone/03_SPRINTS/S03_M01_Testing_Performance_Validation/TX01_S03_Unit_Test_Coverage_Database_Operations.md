- Testing infrastructure: "Test suite runs successfully"

## Description

Implement comprehensive unit tests for critical database CRUD operations across the core repository layer to achieve thorough test coverage. This task focuses on testing the most essential repository methods, entity types (restaurant, dish_or_category, attributes), validation logic, error handling, and edge cases. The testing strategy covers the BaseRepository abstract class and the 2-3 most critical concrete repository implementations: EntityRepository and ConnectionRepository (core business logic), with optional expansion to MentionRepository if time permits.

## Goal / Objectives

Establish robust test coverage for the entire database layer to ensure reliability, maintainability, and confidence in database operations.

- Achieve comprehensive test coverage across the 2-3 most critical repository classes (BaseRepository ✅, EntityRepository, ConnectionRepository)
- Test all CRUD operations for each entity type (restaurant, dish_or_category, dish_attribute, restaurant_attribute)
- Validate error handling and exception scenarios
- Test entity validation logic and type guards
- Cover edge cases and boundary conditions
- Ensure consistent test patterns across all repositories

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All repository methods have corresponding unit tests with comprehensive coverage
- [ ] Entity creation tests cover all entity types: restaurant, dish_or_category, dish_attribute, restaurant_attribute
- [ ] CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) are tested for each repository
- [ ] Validation logic tests cover both success and failure scenarios
- [ ] Error handling tests cover all custom exceptions (EntityNotFoundException, ValidationException, etc.)
- [ ] Edge cases are tested including null/undefined inputs, empty strings, invalid data types
- [ ] BaseRepository abstract class functionality is thoroughly tested
- [ ] Connection repository validation tests ensure proper entity type checking
- [ ] Test coverage report shows comprehensive coverage for repository layer
- [ ] All tests follow consistent patterns and use proper mocking strategies

## Technical Guidance

### Integration Points
- **BaseRepository**: Abstract base class providing common CRUD operations
- **EntityRepository**: Handles unified entity storage (restaurants, dishes, categories, attributes)
- **ConnectionRepository**: Manages entity relationships with validation
- **UserRepository**: User account and subscription management
- **MentionRepository**: Community evidence from Reddit discussions
- **UserEventRepository**: User activity tracking

### Existing Test Patterns
```typescript
// Test module setup pattern
const module: TestingModule = await Test.createTestingModule({
  providers: [
    RepositoryClass,
    {
      provide: PrismaService,
      useValue: mockPrismaService,
    },
    {
      provide: LoggerService,
      useValue: mockLoggerService,
    },
  ],
}).compile();

// Mock setup pattern
const mockPrismaDelegate = {
  create: jest.fn(),
  findUnique: jest.fn(),
  findMany: jest.fn(),
  update: jest.fn(),
  delete: jest.fn(),
  count: jest.fn(),
};
```

### Required Imports
```typescript
import { Test, TestingModule } from '@nestjs/testing';
import { PrismaService } from '../prisma/prisma.service';
import { LoggerService } from '../shared';
import { EntityType, Entity, Prisma } from '@prisma/client';
import {
  ValidationException,
  EntityNotFoundException,
  DatabaseOperationException,
  ForeignKeyConstraintException,
  UniqueConstraintException,
} from './base/repository.exceptions';
```

## Implementation Notes

### Step-by-Step Approach

1. **Audit Existing Tests**
   - Review current test files: entity.repository.spec.ts, connection.repository.spec.ts, base.repository.spec.ts
   - Identify coverage gaps using Jest coverage reports
   - Document missing test scenarios

2. **Complete BaseRepository Tests**
   - Test all CRUD operations with proper error handling
   - Test abstract method implementations
   - Cover Prisma error code handling (P2025 for not found, etc.)
   - Test logging functionality

3. **Enhance EntityRepository Tests**
   - Complete tests for all entity types (restaurant, dish_or_category, dish_attribute, restaurant_attribute)
   - Test validation logic for each entity type
   - Test location-based queries for restaurants
   - Test search functionality (findByNameOrAlias, findByType)
   - Test quality score updates

4. **Expand ConnectionRepository Tests**
   - Test comprehensive validation in createWithValidation
   - Test all relationship query methods (findByRestaurant, findByDish)
   - Test quality metrics updates
   - Test batch operations if available

5. **Create Missing Repository Tests**
   - UserRepository: User CRUD, subscription management, authentication helpers
   - MentionRepository: Mention CRUD, source validation, Reddit data handling
   - UserEventRepository: Event tracking operations

6. **Entity Type Guards Tests**
   - Complete validation function tests
   - Test edge cases for each entity type
   - Test type safety and TypeScript integration

### Testing Strategy

- **Arrange-Act-Assert Pattern**: Structure all tests with clear setup, execution, and verification
- **Mock Strategy**: Mock PrismaService and LoggerService consistently across all tests
- **Error Testing**: Test both expected errors (validation) and unexpected errors (database failures)
- **Data Variation**: Test with minimal required data, full data objects, and invalid data
- **Async Testing**: Properly handle Promise-based operations with async/await

### Coverage Targets

- **Repository Classes**: >90% line coverage
- **Validation Functions**: 100% branch coverage
- **Error Handling**: All exception paths tested
- **Edge Cases**: Null, undefined, empty string, invalid type scenarios

[2025-07-26 03:15]: Code Review - FAIL
**Result:** FAIL - Task scope incomplete despite strong foundation established
**Scope:** TX01_S03 Unit Test Coverage Database Operations (updated requirements without specific 80% coverage target)
**Findings:** 
- Excellent foundation established (Severity 2/10): BaseRepository has comprehensive test coverage with 36 tests and proper patterns
- Scope incomplete (Severity 8/10): Only 1 of 5 critical repository classes completed - missing UserRepository, MentionRepository, UserEventRepository, SubscriptionRepository test suites
- Linting issues (Severity 6/10): 178 remaining linting problems, down from 227 (22% improvement achieved)
- Quality standards (Severity 3/10): BaseRepository demonstrates excellent testing patterns that can be replicated
**Summary:** While BaseRepository implementation provides an excellent foundation with comprehensive coverage and proper testing patterns, the overall task scope remains incomplete. The strong foundation created can serve as a template for completing the remaining repository test suites.
**Recommendation:** Focus on completing 2-3 most critical repository test suites (EntityRepository, ConnectionRepository) rather than all 4 missing repositories to make scope more realistic and achievable.

[2025-07-26 12:15]: Status Re-evaluation - SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS IDENTIFIED
