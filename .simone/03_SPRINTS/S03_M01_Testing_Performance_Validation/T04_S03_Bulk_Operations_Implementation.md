# Task: Bulk Operations Implementation

## Description

Implement and validate high-performance bulk insert/update operations for entities and connections tables using Prisma's native bulk operations. This task focuses on meeting PRD performance targets (<2s for 100 entity batch) while maintaining data integrity and proper error handling. The implementation will extend the existing BaseRepository pattern with optimized batch processing capabilities.

## Goal / Objectives

Deliver production-ready bulk operations that meet performance requirements and integrate seamlessly with the existing codebase:

- Implement bulk insert operations (createMany) for entities and connections
- Implement bulk update operations (updateMany) with conditional logic
- Implement bulk upsert operations for conflict resolution
- Validate performance targets (<2s for 100 entity batch)
- Ensure transaction safety and comprehensive error handling
- Provide monitoring and metrics for bulk operation performance

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Bulk createMany operations complete 100 entities in <2s (PRD target)
- [ ] Bulk updateMany operations handle conditional updates efficiently
- [ ] Bulk upsert operations resolve conflicts correctly
- [ ] Transaction rollback works properly on batch failures
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling with partial failure reporting
- [ ] Performance metrics and logging for bulk operations
- [ ] Unit tests with >90% coverage for all bulk operations
- [ ] Integration tests validating transaction behavior
- [ ] Documentation for bulk operation usage patterns

## Technical Guidance

### Prisma Bulk Operations

The codebase already has basic bulk operations in `/Users/brandonkimble/crave-search/apps/api/src/repositories/base/base.repository.ts`:

```typescript
async createMany(data: TCreateInput[]): Promise<Prisma.BatchPayload>
async updateMany(params: { where: TWhereInput; data: TUpdateInput; }): Promise<Prisma.BatchPayload>
async upsert(params: { where: TWhereInput; create: TCreateInput; update: TUpdateInput; }): Promise<T>
```

### Enhanced Implementation Requirements

1. **Transaction Handling**
   - Use Prisma `$transaction` for atomic batch operations
   - Implement proper rollback on partial failures
   - Batch size optimization for memory efficiency

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement batch size tuning (start with 100-500 per PRD)
   - Connection pooling utilization
   - Memory usage monitoring during bulk operations

3. **Error Handling**
   - Detailed error reporting for failed items in batch
   - Constraint violation handling (unique, foreign key)
   - Partial success scenarios with detailed logging

4. **Monitoring Integration**
   - Database operation timing metrics
   - Batch processing efficiency tracking
   - Memory usage monitoring for bulk operations

### Implementation Approach

#### Phase 1: Enhanced BaseRepository Methods
Extend existing bulk methods with:
- Transaction wrapper support
- Detailed performance logging
- Enhanced error handling with item-level reporting

#### Phase 2: Specialized Bulk Operations
Create domain-specific bulk operations:
- `bulkCreateEntitiesWithValidation()` - Entity creation with type validation
- `bulkCreateConnectionsWithValidation()` - Connection creation with entity validation
- `bulkUpsertEntities()` - Conflict resolution for entity updates

#### Phase 3: Performance Optimization
- Batch size optimization based on operation type
- Connection pooling configuration
- Memory usage profiling and optimization

#### Phase 4: Monitoring and Metrics
- Performance dashboard integration
- Batch operation success/failure tracking
- Resource usage monitoring

### Key Files to Modify

- `/Users/brandonkimble/crave-search/apps/api/src/repositories/base/base.repository.ts` - Enhanced bulk methods
- `/Users/brandonkimble/crave-search/apps/api/src/repositories/entity.repository.ts` - Specialized entity bulk operations
- `/Users/brandonkimble/crave-search/apps/api/src/repositories/connection.repository.ts` - Connection bulk operations
- Add new: `bulk-operations.service.ts` - Orchestration service for complex bulk workflows

### Performance Validation Strategy

1. **Unit Performance Tests**
   - 100 entity batch < 2s target
   - 500 entity batch < 8s (scaling validation)
   - Memory usage < 100MB per batch

2. **Integration Performance Tests**
   - End-to-end bulk entity + connection creation
   - Transaction rollback performance impact
   - Concurrent bulk operation handling

3. **Load Testing**
   - Multiple concurrent bulk operations
   - Resource exhaustion scenarios
   - Error recovery testing

## Implementation Notes

### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Extend BaseRepository with Transaction Support**
   ```typescript
   async bulkCreateWithTransaction<T>(
     operations: Array<() => Promise<T>>,
     options?: { batchSize?: number; }
   ): Promise<T[]>
   ```

2. **Implement Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Item-level error tracking
   - Constraint-specific error messages
   - Partial success reporting

3. **Add Performance Monitoring**
   - Operation timing with correlation IDs
   - Batch size optimization recommendations
   - Resource usage tracking

4. **Create Specialized Domain Methods**
   - Entity bulk operations with type validation
   - Connection bulk operations with relationship validation
   - Bulk attribute assignment operations

5. **Performance Validation**
   - Automated performance tests in CI/CD
   - Performance regression detection
   - Resource usage monitoring

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Individual bulk operation methods
- **Integration Tests**: Full workflow with transaction rollback
- **Performance Tests**: PRD target validation
- **Load Tests**: Concurrent operation handling

The implementation should maintain the existing repository patterns while adding robust bulk operation capabilities that meet the PRD performance requirements.
