# Task: Bulk Operations Implementation

## Description

**SCOPE ADJUSTED FOR REALISM**: Implement core bulk insert/update operations for entities and connections tables using Prisma's native bulk operations. This task focuses on functional bulk operations with basic performance validation, deferring comprehensive monitoring and advanced performance optimization to later milestones.

## Goal / Objectives

Deliver functional bulk operations that establish the foundation for future performance optimization:

- Implement bulk insert operations (createMany) for entities and connections  
- Implement basic bulk update operations (updateMany)
- Implement simple bulk upsert operations for conflict resolution
- Basic performance validation (functional, not comprehensive benchmarking)
- Ensure transaction safety and essential error handling

## Acceptance Criteria

**SCOPE REDUCED - Focus on Core Functionality:**

- [ ] Bulk createMany operations functional for entities and connections (basic timing validation)
- [ ] Bulk updateMany operations handle simple conditional updates
- [ ] Basic bulk upsert operations resolve simple conflicts correctly
- [ ] Transaction rollback works properly on batch failures
- [ ] Essential error handling for batch operation failures
- [ ] Unit tests with comprehensive coverage for core bulk operations
- [ ] Basic integration tests validating transaction behavior
- [ ] Simple documentation for bulk operation usage

- Performance foundation: Establishing bulk operation infrastructure for future performance validation

**Performance Context:**
- **Section 9 Performance Targets**: Response time targets establishing foundation for bulk processing
- Future milestone performance validation: <2s for 100 entity batch processing (validated in later milestones)

## Subtasks

**SCOPE REDUCED - Core Implementation Focus:**

- [ ] Research existing bulk operation patterns in BaseRepository
- [ ] Implement basic createMany with transaction support for entities
- [ ] Implement basic createMany with transaction support for connections
- [ ] Implement simple updateMany operations
- [ ] Implement basic bulk upsert with conflict resolution
- [ ] Implement essential error handling for bulk operations
- [ ] Create unit tests for core bulk operations (comprehensive coverage)
- [ ] Create basic integration tests for transaction behavior
- [ ] Simple documentation and usage examples

## Technical Guidance

### Prisma Bulk Operations

The codebase already has basic bulk operations in `/Users/brandonkimble/crave-search/apps/api/src/repositories/base/base.repository.ts`:

```typescript
async createMany(data: TCreateInput[]): Promise<Prisma.BatchPayload>
async updateMany(params: { where: TWhereInput; data: TUpdateInput; }): Promise<Prisma.BatchPayload>
async upsert(params: { where: TWhereInput; create: TCreateInput; update: TUpdateInput; }): Promise<T>
```

### Enhanced Implementation Requirements

1. **Transaction Handling**
   - Use Prisma `$transaction` for atomic batch operations
   - Implement proper rollback on partial failures
   - Batch size optimization for memory efficiency

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement batch size tuning (start with 100-500 per PRD)
   - Connection pooling utilization
   - Memory usage monitoring during bulk operations

3. **Error Handling**
   - Detailed error reporting for failed items in batch
   - Constraint violation handling (unique, foreign key)
   - Partial success scenarios with detailed logging

4. **Monitoring Integration**
   - Database operation timing metrics
   - Batch processing efficiency tracking
   - Memory usage monitoring for bulk operations

### Implementation Approach

**SIMPLIFIED APPROACH - Core Implementation:**

#### Phase 1: Enhanced BaseRepository Methods
Extend existing bulk methods with:
- Basic transaction wrapper support
- Simple error handling for batch failures
- Essential logging for debugging

#### Phase 2: Core Bulk Operations
Create basic bulk operations:
- `bulkCreateEntities()` - Simple entity creation 
- `bulkCreateConnections()` - Simple connection creation
- `bulkUpsertEntities()` - Basic conflict resolution

#### Phase 3: Testing and Documentation
- Unit and integration tests for bulk operations
- Simple usage documentation and examples
- Basic performance validation (functional testing)

### Key Files to Modify

- `/Users/brandonkimble/crave-search/apps/api/src/repositories/base/base.repository.ts` - Enhanced bulk methods
- `/Users/brandonkimble/crave-search/apps/api/src/repositories/entity.repository.ts` - Specialized entity bulk operations
- `/Users/brandonkimble/crave-search/apps/api/src/repositories/connection.repository.ts` - Connection bulk operations
- Add new: `bulk-operations.service.ts` - Orchestration service for complex bulk workflows

### Performance Validation Strategy

1. **Unit Performance Tests**
   - 100 entity batch < 2s target
   - 500 entity batch < 8s (scaling validation)
   - Memory usage < 100MB per batch

2. **Integration Performance Tests**
   - End-to-end bulk entity + connection creation
   - Transaction rollback performance impact
   - Concurrent bulk operation handling

3. **Load Testing**
   - Multiple concurrent bulk operations
   - Resource exhaustion scenarios
   - Error recovery testing

## Implementation Notes

### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Extend BaseRepository with Transaction Support**
   ```typescript
   async bulkCreateWithTransaction<T>(
     operations: Array<() => Promise<T>>,
     options?: { batchSize?: number; }
   ): Promise<T[]>
   ```

2. **Implement Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Item-level error tracking
   - Constraint-specific error messages
   - Partial success reporting

3. **Add Performance Monitoring**
   - Operation timing with correlation IDs
   - Batch size optimization recommendations
   - Resource usage tracking

4. **Create Specialized Domain Methods**
   - Entity bulk operations with type validation
   - Connection bulk operations with relationship validation
   - Bulk attribute assignment operations

5. **Performance Validation**
   - Automated performance tests in CI/CD
   - Performance regression detection
   - Resource usage monitoring

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Individual bulk operation methods
- **Integration Tests**: Full workflow with transaction rollback
- **Performance Tests**: PRD target validation
- **Load Tests**: Concurrent operation handling

The implementation should maintain the existing repository patterns while adding robust bulk operation capabilities that meet the PRD performance requirements.
