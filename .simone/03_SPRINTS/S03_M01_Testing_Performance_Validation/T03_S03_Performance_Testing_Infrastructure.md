# Task: Basic Performance Testing Setup

## Description

Set up basic performance testing infrastructure to validate database operations functionality for M01 Database Foundation milestone. This task focuses on establishing minimal benchmarking capabilities to ensure database CRUD operations and bulk inserts are functional, not comprehensive performance testing (which belongs in later milestones).

The goal is to validate that database operations work correctly and establish basic timing measurements for foundational functionality validation.

## Goal / Objectives

Establish basic performance validation to confirm M01 database operations are functional.

- Set up minimal database benchmark utilities for basic operation timing
- Create simple performance validation for CRUD operations
- Establish basic connection pooling functionality validation
- Document baseline database operation timing for future reference

## Acceptance Criteria

Specific, measurable conditions that must be met for this task to be considered 'done'.

- [ ] Basic database benchmark utilities created for CRUD operation timing
- [ ] Simple performance validation confirms bulk insert operations are functional
- [ ] Connection pooling functionality validated (not comprehensive performance testing)
- [ ] Basic timing measurements documented for database operations
- [ ] Foundation established for future performance testing in M05

- [ ] Document performance testing procedures and interpretation guidelines
- [ ] Create performance alerting thresholds and notifications
- [ ] Validate performance tests against PRD requirements

## Technical Guidance

### k6 Configuration

The k6 framework should be configured with multiple test scenarios to validate different aspects of system performance:

**Installation and Setup:**
```bash
# Install k6 via package manager or download binary
npm install --save-dev k6
# or
brew install k6
```

**Test Script Structure:**
- **Load Testing**: Gradual ramp-up to target concurrent users (1,000-2,000)
- **Stress Testing**: Push beyond normal capacity to find breaking points
- **Spike Testing**: Sudden traffic increases to test elasticity
- **Endurance Testing**: Sustained load over extended periods

**Key Test Scenarios:**
1. **Search Query Performance**: Validate <400ms cached, <3s uncached response times
2. **Database Query Performance**: Ensure queries execute in <1s
3. **Connection Pool Efficiency**: Monitor pool utilization under load
4. **Concurrent User Handling**: Test 1,000-2,000 concurrent users
5. **Throughput Validation**: Achieve 50 searches/second target

### Benchmark Utilities

Create specialized utilities for measuring specific system components:

**Database Query Benchmarks:**
- Individual query execution time measurement
- Batch operation performance testing
- Connection acquisition timing
- Transaction rollback/commit performance
- Index utilization efficiency

**Connection Pool Benchmarks:**
- Pool utilization under various load patterns
- Connection acquisition/release timing
- Pool exhaustion recovery testing
- Idle connection management validation

**Entity Resolution Benchmarks:**
- Fuzzy matching performance with different dataset sizes
- Batch processing efficiency measurements
- Memory usage tracking during bulk operations
- Resolution accuracy vs. performance tradeoffs

### Performance Monitoring Integration

Leverage existing database health check infrastructure:

**Existing Monitoring Endpoints:**
- `/health/database` - Basic connectivity status
- `/health/database/metrics` - Comprehensive pool and query metrics
- `/health/database/detailed` - System health with performance alerts

**Enhanced Monitoring Features:**
- Real-time performance metric collection
- Historical performance trend analysis
- Automated alert generation for threshold breaches
- Performance regression detection
- Correlation analysis between different metrics

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
- Response time percentiles (P50, P95, P99)
- Throughput (requests per second)
- Error rates and timeout frequencies
- Resource utilization (CPU, memory, database connections)
- Cache hit/miss ratios

## Implementation Notes

Step-by-step approach for setting up performance testing infrastructure:

### Phase 1: k6 Framework Setup
1. **Install k6 and dependencies** in the API project
2. **Create test directory structure** under `apps/api/performance-tests/`
3. **Implement base test configuration** with environment-specific settings
4. **Create utility functions** for common test operations (authentication, data setup)

### Phase 2: Core Test Scripts Development
1. **Search endpoint tests** - Validate query processing performance
2. **Entity resolution tests** - Measure fuzzy matching and batch processing
3. **Database operation tests** - Query execution and connection pool testing
4. **Health check tests** - Validate monitoring endpoint performance

### Phase 3: Database Benchmark Utilities
1. **Query performance measurement** - Individual and batch query timing
2. **Connection pool testing** - Pool utilization and efficiency metrics
3. **Transaction performance** - Commit/rollback timing under load
4. **Index optimization validation** - Query plan analysis and optimization

### Phase 4: Monitoring and Alerting
1. **Integrate with existing health checks** - Enhance current monitoring system
2. **Create performance dashboards** - Real-time and historical views
3. **Configure alerting thresholds** - Based on PRD performance targets
4. **Implement automated regression testing** - Continuous performance validation

### Phase 5: Documentation and Procedures
1. **Test execution documentation** - How to run performance tests
2. **Metric interpretation guides** - Understanding performance data
3. **Performance tuning procedures** - How to optimize based on test results
4. **Regression testing automation** - Integration with CI/CD pipeline

### Configuration Examples

**k6 Test Configuration:**
```javascript
export let options = {
  stages: [
    { duration: '2m', target: 100 }, // Ramp up
    { duration: '5m', target: 100 }, // Stay at 100 users
    { duration: '2m', target: 200 }, // Ramp to 200 users
    { duration: '5m', target: 200 }, // Stay at 200 users
    { duration: '2m', target: 0 },   // Ramp down
  ],
  thresholds: {
    http_req_duration: ['p(95)<3000'], // 95% of requests under 3s
    http_req_duration: ['p(50)<400'],  // 50% of requests under 400ms
    http_req_failed: ['rate<0.05'],    // Error rate under 5%
  },
};
```

**Database Benchmark Configuration:**
```typescript
interface BenchmarkConfig {
  iterations: number;
  concurrency: number;
  warmupIterations: number;
  queryTypes: string[];
  datasetSize: 'small' | 'medium' | 'large';
  includeConnectionTiming: boolean;
}
```

### Success Validation Criteria

**Performance Target Validation:**
- Search queries consistently achieve <400ms (cached) response times
- Uncached queries with LLM processing complete within <3s
- Database queries execute in <1s under normal load
- System handles 50 searches/second sustained throughput
- 1,000-2,000 concurrent users supported without degradation

**Infrastructure Validation:**
- k6 tests run reliably in CI/CD pipeline
- Performance metrics collected and stored consistently
- Alerts trigger appropriately for threshold breaches
- Regression tests detect performance degradation
- Documentation enables team members to execute and interpret tests
