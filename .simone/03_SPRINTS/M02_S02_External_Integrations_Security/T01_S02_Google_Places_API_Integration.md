# Task: Google Places API Integration

## Description

Implement Google Places API integration to enrich restaurant entities with location data and operational hours. This establishes the foundation for location services and restaurant data enrichment as required by PRD section 9.2.1 for M02 completion.

## Goal / Objectives

Implement Google Places API integration that enriches restaurant entities with accurate location and hours data.

- Set up Google Places API client with authentication and error handling
- Implement restaurant data enrichment functionality  
- Add location and hours data to restaurant entities
- Handle API errors gracefully with proper retry logic

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Google Places API client successfully connects and authenticates
- [ ] Restaurant entities are enriched with location data (latitude, longitude, address)
- [ ] Restaurant entities include operational hours from Google Places
- [ ] API errors are handled gracefully with retry logic
- [ ] Integration follows external integrations module architecture
- [ ] System processes sample restaurant data end-to-end without critical errors
