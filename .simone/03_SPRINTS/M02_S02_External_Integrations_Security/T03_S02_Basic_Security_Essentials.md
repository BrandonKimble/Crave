# Task: Basic Security Essentials

## Description

Implement basic security essentials including input validation, basic rate limiting, and essential API security to protect against common attacks and malformed requests. This establishes the security foundation for external API interactions as required by PRD section 9.2.1 for M02 completion.

## Goal / Objectives

Implement essential security measures that prevent common injection attacks and malformed requests while securing API interactions.

- Implement input validation for all API endpoints
- Add basic rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Implement essential API security measures
- Ensure validation prevents common injection attacks
- Add request sanitization and validation

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Input validation prevents common injection attacks (SQL injection, XSS, etc.)
- [ ] Basic rate limiting prevents API abuse and DoS attacks
- [ ] Request validation rejects malformed requests gracefully
- [ ] API security headers are properly configured
- [ ] Validation middleware is applied consistently across endpoints
- [ ] Error responses don't expose sensitive system information
- [ ] Security measures integrate with external integrations module
