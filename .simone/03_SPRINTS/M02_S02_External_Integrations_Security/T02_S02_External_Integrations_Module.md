# Task: External Integrations Module

## Description

Create a centralized external integrations module to manage API connections for google-places, reddit-api, and llm-api with basic rate limiting and error handling. This establishes the foundation for all external service integrations as required by PRD section 9.2.1 for M02 completion.

## Goal / Objectives

Implement a centralized external integrations module that provides consistent API management across all external services.

- Create external integrations domain module following modular monolith architecture
- Implement centralized API management for Google Places, Reddit API, and LLM API
- Add basic rate limiting for external API calls
- Implement graceful error handling with proper retry logic
- Ensure module follows NestJS dependency injection patterns

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] External integrations module created following domain-driven structure
- [ ] Centralized API management handles Google Places, Reddit API, and LLM API
- [ ] Basic rate limiting prevents API quota exhaustion
- [ ] Error handling gracefully manages API failures with retry logic
- [ ] Module integrates with existing LLM and Google Places implementations
- [ ] All external API calls go through the centralized module
- [ ] Module follows NestJS dependency injection and modular architecture

## PRD References

**IMPLEMENTS PRD REQUIREMENTS:**

- Section 9.2.1: External integrations module - Centralized API management, basic rate limiting for google-places, reddit-api, llm-api
- Section 9.2.2: External integrations module handles API errors gracefully with proper retry logic
- Section 3.1.2: API Modular Monolith Structure - external-integrations domain with google-places, reddit-api, llm-api, notification-services
- Section 2.5: External APIs - Reddit API, Google Places API, Gemini/Deepseek LLM API

**BROADER CONTEXT:**
- Section 1: Overview & Core System Architecture (all subsections)
- Section 2: Technology Stack (all subsections)
- Section 3: Hybrid Monorepo & Modular Monolith Architecture (all subsections)
- Section 4: Data Model & Database Architecture (all subsections)
- Section 5: Data Collection Strategy & Architecture (all subsections)
- Section 6: Reddit Data Collection Process (all subsections)
- Section 9.2: Complete milestone requirements
- Section 10: POST-MVP Roadmap context

**SCOPE BOUNDARIES FROM PRD:**

- **NOT implementing**: Actual Reddit API data collection (deferred to M03 - PRD section 9.3)
- **NOT implementing**: Advanced rate limiting or distributed rate limiting (deferred to Post-MVP)
- **NOT implementing**: Notification services beyond basic structure (deferred to later milestones)
- **NOT implementing**: Complex API monitoring or analytics (deferred to Post-MVP)

## Subtasks

- [ ] Create external-integrations domain module structure
- [ ] Implement centralized API client base with common error handling
- [ ] Add basic rate limiting functionality for external APIs
- [ ] Create service interfaces for Google Places, Reddit API, and LLM API
- [ ] Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for API failures
- [ ] Integrate existing LLM and Google Places services into the module
- [ ] Add configuration management for API keys and rate limits
- [ ] Create integration tests for the external integrations module
