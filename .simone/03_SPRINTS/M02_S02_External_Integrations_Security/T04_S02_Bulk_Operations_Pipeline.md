# Task: Bulk Operations Pipeline

## Description

Implement a bulk operations pipeline with multi-row inserts/updates and transaction management to efficiently process batches of entities without data corruption. This completes the entity processing foundation as required by PRD section 9.2.1 for M02 completion.

## Goal / Objectives

Implement efficient bulk operations that can process batches of entities with proper transaction management and data integrity.

- Create bulk insert/update operations for entities, connections, and mentions
- Implement proper transaction management for batch operations
- Add batch processing optimization for database efficiency
- Ensure data integrity and prevent corruption during bulk operations
- Integrate with existing entity resolution system

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Bulk operations successfully process batches of entities without data corruption
- [ ] Multi-row inserts/updates minimize database round trips
- [ ] Transaction management ensures data integrity during batch operations
- [ ] Bulk operations integrate with entity resolution system
- [ ] Performance is optimized for large batch processing
- [ ] Error handling properly rolls back failed transactions
- [ ] System maintains data consistency during concurrent bulk operations
