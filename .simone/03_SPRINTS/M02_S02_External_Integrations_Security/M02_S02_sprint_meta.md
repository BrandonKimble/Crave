# Sprint: External Integrations, Security & Bulk Operations (S02)

## Sprint Goal

**PRD-ALIGNED OBJECTIVE:** Implement Google Places API integration, external integrations module, security essentials, and bulk operations pipeline to complete M02 entity processing foundation.

## Scope & Key Deliverables

**IMPLEMENTS PRD SECTIONS:** [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9.2, 10]

- **Google Places API integration**: Restaurant data enrichment, location services setup
- **External integrations module**: Centralized API management, basic rate limiting for google-places, reddit-api, llm-api
- **Basic security essentials**: Input validation, basic rate limiting, essential API security
- **Bulk operations pipeline**: Multi-row inserts/updates, transaction management

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)

**DERIVED FROM PRD SUCCESS CRITERIA:**

- Google Places API integration enriches restaurant entities with location and hours data
- External integrations module handles API errors gracefully with proper retry logic
- Basic security validation prevents common injection attacks and malformed requests
- Bulk operations successfully process batches of entities without data corruption
- System processes sample data end-to-end without critical errors (full M02 completion)

## Scope Boundaries

**ENFORCED FROM PRD ROADMAP:**

- **NOT included**: Hybrid Data Collection Implementation (deferred to M03 - PRD section 9.3)
- **NOT included**: Dynamic Query System (deferred to M04 - PRD section 9.4)
- **NOT included**: Ranking & Scoring algorithms (deferred to M05 - PRD section 9.5)
- **NOT included**: Complex multi-attribute queries (deferred to M06 - PRD section 9.6)
- **NOT included**: Mobile app implementation (deferred to M07 - PRD section 9.7)
- **NOT included**: Advanced caching beyond basic implementation (deferred to Post-MVP milestones)
- **Boundary**: Tasks implement ONLY external integrations, security, and bulk operations requirements from PRD sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9.2, 10
