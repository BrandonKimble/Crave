# Project Manifest: Crave Search

This manifest serves as the central reference point for the Crave Search food discovery platform. It tracks the current focus and links to key documentation.

## 1. Project Vision & Overview

**Crave Search** transforms scattered Reddit food discussions into actionable dining insights. Users can quickly make confident dining decisions through evidence-based dish and restaurant recommendations powered by community knowledge.

**Core Value Proposition:**

- **Evidence-Based Discovery**: Every recommendation backed by specific community mentions and upvotes
- **Dish-Centric Focus**: Find the best version of what you're craving, not just good restaurants
- **Community-Powered**: Leverages authentic discussions from Reddit food communities
- **Mobile-First Experience**: Optimized for quick decisions with detailed evidence when needed

This project follows a milestone-based development approach with a comprehensive 31-week pre-MVP roadmap.

## 2. Current Focus

**Milestone M03: Hybrid Data Collection Implementation** (Week 5-6)

Implementing the hybrid data collection system using both Pushshift archives for comprehensive historical coverage and Reddit API for real-time updates. This milestone establishes the community content foundation through stream processing of large historical datasets and scheduled real-time collection with proper gap tracking and data continuity monitoring.
