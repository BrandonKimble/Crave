# Project Manifest: Crave Search

This manifest serves as the central reference point for the Crave Search food discovery platform. It tracks the current focus and links to key documentation.

## 1. Project Vision & Overview

**Crave Search** transforms scattered Reddit food discussions into actionable dining insights. Users can quickly make confident dining decisions through evidence-based dish and restaurant recommendations powered by community knowledge.

**Core Value Proposition:**

- **Evidence-Based Discovery**: Every recommendation backed by specific community mentions and upvotes
- **Dish-Centric Focus**: Find the best version of what you're craving, not just good restaurants
- **Community-Powered**: Leverages authentic discussions from Reddit food communities
- **Mobile-First Experience**: Optimized for quick decisions with detailed evidence when needed

This project follows a milestone-based development approach with a comprehensive 31-week pre-MVP roadmap.

## 2. Current Focus

**Milestone M02: Entity Processing Core & External Integrations** (Week 3-4)

Building the core entity processing pipeline with LLM integration for content analysis, comprehensive entity resolution system, and external API integrations (Google Places, Reddit API). This milestone establishes the foundation for content processing and location services.
