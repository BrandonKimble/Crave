# Project Manifest: Crave - Local Food Discovery App

This manifest serves as the central reference point for the Crave project. It tracks the current focus and links to key documentation.

## 1. Project Vision & Overview

**Crave** transforms scattered Reddit community knowledge into evidence-based dish and restaurant recommendations. The app enables users to quickly make confident dining decisions by surfacing specific community mentions and upvotes about dishes and restaurants.

**Core Value Proposition:**
- **Evidence-Based Discovery**: Every recommendation backed by specific community mentions and upvotes
- **Dish-Centric Focus**: Find the best version of what you're craving, not just good restaurants  
- **Community-Powered**: Leverages authentic discussions from Reddit food communities
- **Mobile-First Experience**: Optimized for quick decisions with detailed evidence when needed

This project follows a milestone-based development approach with a **30-week Pre-MVP roadmap**.
