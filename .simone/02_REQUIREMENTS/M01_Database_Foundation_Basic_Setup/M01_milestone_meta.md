## Milestone: Database Foundation & Basic Setup

### Goals and Key Deliverables

- Create comprehensive database schema with all core tables (entities, connections, mentions)
- Implement basic CRUD operations for all entity types (restaurant, dish_or_category, attributes)
- Set up database migration system and version control using Prisma
- Establish testing infrastructure with comprehensive code coverage for database operations
- Configure development environment with proper connection pooling and error handling
- Implement bulk insert capabilities for efficient data processing

### Key Documents

- `PRD.md` - Full Product Requirements Document
- `PRD.md` sections: 4, 2, 3, 1, 9, 10
- `CLAUDE.md` - Project architecture and development guide

### Definition of Done (DoD)

- ✅ Database schema created with all foreign key relationships properly enforced
- ✅ Basic CRUD operations functional for all entity types
- ✅ Migration system successfully creates and applies schema changes
- ✅ Test suite runs successfully with comprehensive code coverage for database operations
- ✅ Local development environment setup documented and reproducible
- ✅ Basic logging captures database operations and errors
- ✅ Connection pooling configured and functional
- ✅ Database supports bulk insert operations (performance validation in later milestones)

### Scope Boundaries

- **NOT included**: Complex query optimization (deferred to later milestones)
- **NOT included**: Redis caching layer (Milestone 2/3)
- **NOT included**: LLM integration or entity processing (Milestone 2)
- **NOT included**: Reddit data collection (Milestone 3)
- **NOT included**: Production-level monitoring or alerting
- **NOT included**: Complex ranking algorithms or scoring (Milestone 5)

### Notes / Context

This is the foundational milestone - nothing works without the database layer. Focus is on creating a solid, well-tested foundation that supports the graph-based entity model described in the PRD. The database design must support:

- Unified entity storage with type differentiation
- Flexible connections between restaurants and dishes
- Reddit mention evidence tracking
- Future scaling to millions of entities

Dependencies: None - this is the first milestone that everything else builds upon.
