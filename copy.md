### 5.2b Long Description – Version 1.5 (Merged & Recommended)

> Merged version of v1 + extra keywords (food guide, travel, AI / smart scoring). Use this as the primary long description and keep v1 above as a lean variant.

**Paragraph 1 – Dish‑first city food guide**

Crave is your **dish‑first city food guide** that tells you exactly **what to order** at each place—not just which restaurants exist. Instead of scrolling through endless reviews, star ratings, and listicles, Crave shows you **ranked lists of the best dishes, best restaurants, and hidden gems nearby**, so you can spend less time searching and more time eating.

**Paragraph 2 – How rankings work (crowdsourced + smart / AI‑assisted scoring)**

Every ranking in Crave is **crowdsourced from real people and local food communities**, then run through a smart scoring system that weighs **votes, frequency of praise, recency, and consistency**. Behind the scenes, **data‑driven analysis (including AI‑assisted signals)** helps surface high‑signal praise and filter out noise, so Dish scores update as **trending restaurants, hot spots, and new places** pick up buzz. You see what’s **actually good right now**, not just what used to be popular.

**Paragraph 3 – “Near me” and craving‑based discovery**

Open the app and search for cravings like **“ramen near me”**, **“best tacos”**, **“sushi”, “pizza”, “brunch”, “burger”**, or simply browse the **restaurant map near me**. Crave works as both a **restaurant finder** and a **food discovery app**: it highlights the **top dishes and top restaurants near you**, then lets you filter by **open now, price level, and neighborhood** to match your mood and budget.

**Paragraph 4 – Locals, travelers, and occasions**

Use Crave to plan a **date night restaurant**, find **cheap eats** for a quick **lunch near me**, pick a spot for **group dinner**, **takeout**, or **late night food**, or build a **foodie hit list** before a trip. Whether you live in **[PRIMARY_CITY]** or you’re visiting as a tourist, Crave helps you discover **local favorites**, avoid tourist traps, and get more out of every meal when you travel.

**Paragraph 5 – Live polls and community**

Crave isn’t just a static list—it’s a **community‑driven restaurant and food guide**. Vote in live polls like “Best [dish] in [city]” or “What should I order at [restaurant]?”, see results update in real time, and watch your votes nudge dishes up and down the rankings. The more people use it, the better the **crowdsourced recommendations** get for everyone.

**Paragraph 6 – Why it’s different from other restaurant apps**

Most **restaurant apps** and review platforms focus on long review feeds and generic 5‑star ratings. Crave is built for **foodies, travelers, and locals** who care about specific dishes and want a clear answer to “What should I order here?” By combining **community data with smart, data‑driven scoring and AI‑assisted analysis**, Crave makes picking a place for **breakfast, lunch, brunch, dinner, or late night** feel effortless.

**Paragraph 7 – City focus, roadmap, and privacy**

We’re starting in **[PRIMARY_CITY]** with a focus on serious local food and expanding to more cities as we gather enough high‑quality signal to keep rankings accurate.
