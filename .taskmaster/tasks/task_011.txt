# Task ID: 11
# Title: Community Engagement System with Reddit Attribution
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement community engagement system with Reddit attribution, activity indicators, top mentions scoring, and conversation CTAs to display Reddit quotes with proper attribution and seamless links back to original discussions.
# Details:
Build comprehensive community engagement system with Reddit attribution display showing original usernames, timestamps, and subreddit sources. Implement time-weighted activity scoring algorithm that calculates trending (üî•) and active (üïê) indicators based on recent mention frequency and engagement metrics. Create top mentions scoring system that ranks Reddit comments by relevance, upvotes, and recency. Design 'Join conversation' CTAs that deep-link users to original Reddit threads with proper URL formatting. Implement quote cards with truncated content, full attribution metadata, and responsive design for mobile and web. Setup activity calculation service that processes mention timestamps and calculates rolling activity scores over 24h/7d windows. Create engagement tracking to monitor CTA click-through rates and user interaction patterns. Implement proper Reddit content licensing compliance and attribution requirements. Setup caching for activity scores and mention rankings to optimize performance. Configure background jobs to refresh activity indicators every 30 minutes.

# Test Strategy:
Verify Reddit quotes display with complete attribution (username, subreddit, timestamp), test activity indicators update correctly based on time-weighted scoring algorithm, confirm 'Join conversation' CTAs generate valid Reddit URLs that open to correct threads, validate top mentions ranking reflects engagement metrics accurately, test quote truncation works properly with read-more functionality, verify activity scores calculate correctly over different time windows, confirm system handles deleted/removed Reddit content gracefully
