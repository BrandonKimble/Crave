# Task ID: 15
# Title: Performance Monitoring and Testing Infrastructure
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 4, 8
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement comprehensive performance monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana and complete testing infrastructure including E2E and load testing for full application observability and performance optimization.
# Details:
Setup Prometheus metrics collection with custom application metrics for API response times, database query performance, cache hit rates, and business metrics (searches/minute, entity processing rates). Configure Grafana dashboards for real-time monitoring with alerting rules for performance degradation, error rates, and resource utilization. Implement OpenTelemetry instrumentation for distributed tracing across all services. Setup E2E testing suite using Playwright/Cypress covering critical user journeys: search flows, discovery features, and social sharing. Implement load testing with Artillery/k6 to simulate realistic traffic patterns and validate performance under stress. Create performance budgets with automated CI/CD integration that fails builds on regression. Setup log aggregation with structured logging for debugging and analytics. Configure health checks and readiness probes for all services. Implement automated performance regression detection and alerting.

# Test Strategy:
Verify Prometheus collects all defined metrics with 99.9% reliability, confirm Grafana dashboards display real-time data with <5s refresh rates, test alerting rules trigger correctly for threshold breaches, validate E2E tests cover >90% of critical user paths with <10min execution time, confirm load tests can simulate 1000+ concurrent users with realistic patterns, verify performance budgets prevent regressions in CI/CD pipeline, test distributed tracing provides complete request visibility across all services
