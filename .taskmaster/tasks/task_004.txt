# Task ID: 4
# Title: External API Integrations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement Reddit API, Google Places API, and LLM API integrations with proper error handling and rate limiting
# Details:
Setup Reddit API client with authentication, rate limiting (100 requests/minute), and cost management ($0.24/1000 calls). Implement Google Places API integration for restaurant location data, hours, and metadata. Configure LLM API client (Gemini/Deepseek) for content analysis and entity extraction. Implement proper error handling, retry logic, and circuit breaker patterns. Setup API key management and rotation. Create fallback strategy for Reddit API using Pushshift data if comment access unavailable. Include comprehensive logging and monitoring for all external API calls.

# Test Strategy:
Test Reddit API can fetch posts and comments from food subreddits, verify Google Places returns restaurant data with coordinates, confirm LLM API processes content and returns structured entities, validate rate limiting prevents API overuse
