# Task ID: 6
# Title: Content Processing Pipeline
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the complete content processing pipeline from Reddit data to structured entities with scoring
# Details:
Build comprehensive content processing pipeline: Reddit API search and retrieval → LLM entity extraction → entity resolution → component-based processing → database updates. Implement six processing components handling all entity combinations (restaurant creation, attribute assignment, general praise boosting, specific dish processing, category processing, attribute-only processing). Create mention scoring system with time-weighted formulas and activity level calculation. Setup bulk database operations in single atomic transactions. Implement quality score computation for both dishes and restaurants. Include background job orchestration for scheduled processing cycles.

# Test Strategy:
Process sample Reddit content and verify entities extracted correctly, test all six processing components handle their scenarios, confirm quality scores computed accurately, validate bulk operations maintain atomicity

### Details:
Build fuzzy matching algorithms and integrate with external databases to resolve entity names to standardized identifiers. Handle ambiguous matches and maintain confidence scores.

## 4. Six Processing Components Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.3
### Description: Develop the core processing pipeline components for sentiment analysis, context extraction, relevance scoring, temporal analysis, geographic detection, and thread tracking
### Details:
Implement sentiment analysis, context extraction, relevance scoring, temporal pattern analysis, geographic location detection, and conversation thread tracking. Each component should be modular and independently testable.

## 5. Mention Scoring System [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.4
### Description: Create comprehensive scoring algorithm that evaluates entity mentions based on sentiment, context, engagement, and other factors
### Details:
Develop weighted scoring system that combines sentiment scores, engagement metrics, context relevance, and temporal factors. Include configurable weights and threshold settings.

## 6. Bulk Database Operations [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.5
### Description: Implement efficient database operations for storing processed Reddit data, entities, and mention scores with optimized batch processing
### Details:
Design database schema and implement bulk insert/update operations for Reddit posts, comments, extracted entities, and calculated scores. Include data deduplication and conflict resolution.

## 7. Background Job Orchestration [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.6
### Description: Build job queue system to orchestrate the entire processing pipeline with monitoring, error handling, and scalability features
### Details:
Implement job queue with Redis/Celery or similar technology. Include job scheduling, progress tracking, error handling, retry logic, and monitoring dashboard for the complete pipeline.

## 8. Design content retrieval stage [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the first stage of the pipeline for retrieving content from various sources with proper error handling and retry logic
### Details:
Create content retrieval module that handles fetching from multiple sources (APIs, files, databases) with configurable retry policies, rate limiting, and error handling. Include logging and metrics collection for monitoring retrieval performance.

## 9. Build entity extraction stage [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.8
### Description: Develop the entity extraction processing stage that identifies and extracts relevant entities from retrieved content
### Details:
Implement entity extraction using NLP libraries or AI models to identify people, places, organizations, dates, and other relevant entities. Include confidence scoring and validation mechanisms.

## 10. Implement resolution integration stage [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.9
### Description: Create the resolution integration stage that matches and resolves extracted entities against known databases or external services
### Details:
Build entity resolution system that matches extracted entities to canonical forms, handles disambiguation, and integrates with external knowledge bases. Include caching and bulk processing capabilities.

## 11. Develop component processing stage with six analysis modules [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.10
### Description: Build the component processing stage containing sentiment analysis, context extraction, relevance scoring, temporal analysis, geographic detection, and thread tracking modules
### Details:
Create six independent processing components: 1) Sentiment analysis for emotional tone detection, 2) Context extraction for meaning and relationships, 3) Relevance scoring for importance ranking, 4) Temporal analysis for time-based patterns, 5) Geographic detection for location identification, 6) Thread tracking for conversation continuity. Each component should be independently testable and scalable.

## 12. Build scoring system stage [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.11
### Description: Implement the scoring system that aggregates results from all component processing modules and generates final scores
### Details:
Create scoring aggregation system that combines outputs from all six processing components into unified scoring metrics. Include configurable weighting, normalization, and ranking algorithms with performance optimization for bulk processing.

## 13. Create database operations and job orchestration stage [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.12
### Description: Develop the final stage for database operations and job orchestration that manages the entire pipeline execution
### Details:
Build database operations layer for atomic transactions, bulk insertions, and data consistency. Implement job orchestration system for managing pipeline execution, handling failures, monitoring progress, and ensuring scalability across all stages.
