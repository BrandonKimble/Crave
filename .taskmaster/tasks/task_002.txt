# Task ID: 2
# Title: Database Schema Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the PostgreSQL database schema with graph-based entity model and all required indexes
# Details:
Create PostgreSQL database with entities, connections, mentions, users, and subscriptions tables. Implement graph-based unified entity model with entity_type enum (restaurant, dish_or_category, dish_attribute, restaurant_attribute). Setup all required indexes for performance: GIN indexes for arrays and text search, spatial indexes for location queries, composite indexes for common query patterns. Configure Prisma ORM with schema definition and migration system. Setup connection pooling with 50 connections for MVP. Implement UPSERT operations for bulk processing.

# Test Strategy:
Verify all tables created correctly with proper constraints, test index performance with sample data, confirm Prisma migrations work, validate bulk operations handle 1000+ entities in <500ms
