# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Turborepo Monorepo Structure
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the hybrid monorepo architecture with Turborepo, establishing the foundation for API and mobile applications
# Details:
Create the root monorepo structure with apps/ and packages/ directories. Setup Turborepo configuration (turbo.json) with build pipelines for API and mobile apps. Configure pnpm workspace (pnpm-workspace.yaml) and root package.json with workspace dependencies. Setup shared package structure (@crave-search/shared) for common types and utilities. Configure development workflow commands (pnpm dev, turbo run lint, etc.). Setup Lefthook for git hooks and code quality enforcement.

# Test Strategy:
Verify monorepo structure is correct, ensure workspace dependencies resolve properly, test build pipelines execute successfully, confirm shared package imports work across apps

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create monorepo directory structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the basic directory structure for the monorepo with apps, packages, and shared tooling folders
### Details:
Create root-level directories: apps/ (for applications), packages/ (for shared packages), tools/ (for build tools), and configure proper .gitignore patterns for monorepo structure

## 2. Configure Turborepo setup [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Initialize Turborepo configuration with turbo.json for build orchestration and caching
### Details:
Install Turborepo, create turbo.json with pipeline definitions for build, test, lint, and dev tasks. Configure task dependencies and caching strategies

## 3. Setup workspace configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Configure package.json workspaces and package manager settings for monorepo
### Details:
Update root package.json with workspace patterns, configure npm/yarn/pnpm workspace settings, set up shared dependencies and scripts

## 4. Create shared packages setup [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2, 1.3
### Description: Implement shared utility packages, UI components, and configuration packages
### Details:
Create packages for shared utilities, TypeScript configurations, ESLint configs, and UI components. Set up proper package.json exports and build configurations

## 5. Configure development workflow and git hooks [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.4
### Description: Set up development commands, git hooks, and CI/CD pipeline integration
### Details:
Configure Husky for git hooks, set up pre-commit linting and testing, create npm scripts for common workflows, and integrate with Turborepo for efficient builds
