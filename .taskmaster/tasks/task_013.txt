Implement share analytics to track which content performs best and optimize templates accordingly. Setup deep linking system for shared content that maintains context and attribution. Create social CTA system that suggests optimal sharing opportunities based on user behavior and content quality. Include privacy controls for users to manage what can be shared and by whom. Setup A/B testing framework for share templates and viral mechanics optimization.

# Test Strategy:
Verify bookmark sharing generates proper links that maintain attribution and context when accessed. Test Reddit post templates include all required elements (attribution, context, formatting) and generate engaging content. Confirm social media integrations post successfully with rich previews and appropriate hashtags. Validate viral mechanics track referrals correctly and update leaderboards in real-time. Test deep links resolve to correct content with proper context preservation. Verify share analytics capture engagement metrics and optimize template performance over time.
