# Task ID: 5
# Title: Entity Resolution System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement three-tier entity resolution system with exact, alias, and fuzzy matching capabilities
# Details:
Build entity resolution pipeline with three-tier matching: exact name matching, alias array matching, and fuzzy matching with Levenshtein distance. Implement scope-aware resolution for context-dependent attributes (Italian dish vs Italian restaurant). Create in-memory ID mapping for batch processing efficiency. Setup bulk entity creation with UPSERT operations. Implement alias management system that automatically adds variations when entities are merged. Optimize for processing 100 entity batches in <2 seconds. Include duplicate prevention and confidence scoring for merge decisions.

# Test Strategy:
Test resolution accuracy >80% on sample data, verify scope-aware attribute resolution works correctly, confirm batch processing meets timing requirements, validate alias management prevents duplicates

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement three-tier matching system [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build hierarchical matching algorithm with exact, fuzzy, and contextual matching tiers
### Details:
Create a multi-level matching system that first attempts exact matches, then fuzzy string matching, and finally contextual/semantic matching. Each tier should have configurable thresholds and fallback mechanisms.

## 2. Develop scope-aware resolution logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Implement context-sensitive matching that considers data scope and domain boundaries
### Details:
Build resolution logic that understands data context, domain boundaries, and scope limitations. Should prevent cross-domain matches and respect data boundaries while maintaining accuracy.

## 3. Create in-memory ID mapping system [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Build efficient in-memory data structure for fast ID lookups and mapping operations
### Details:
Implement high-performance in-memory mapping system using appropriate data structures (hash maps, trees) for fast ID resolution. Include memory management and cache invalidation strategies.

## 4. Implement bulk processing optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2, 5.3
### Description: Optimize matching system for high-volume batch processing with performance monitoring
### Details:
Add batch processing capabilities with parallel processing, memory optimization, and performance monitoring. Include progress tracking and error handling for large datasets.

## 5. Build alias management with merge confidence scoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.4
### Description: Implement alias tracking system with confidence scoring for merge recommendations
### Details:
Create alias management system that tracks entity relationships and calculates merge confidence scores. Include manual review workflows for low-confidence matches and automatic merging for high-confidence matches.
