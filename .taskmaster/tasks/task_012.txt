# Task ID: 12
# Title: Discovery Features System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 7, 8
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement comprehensive discovery features including discovery feed, trending analysis engine, recently discussed content, and hidden gems algorithm to provide curated content discovery and recommendations based on community patterns.
# Details:
Build discovery feed system with personalized content recommendations based on user preferences and community activity. Implement trending analysis engine that analyzes mention frequency, engagement velocity, and time-weighted scoring to identify trending dishes and restaurants. Create recently discussed content system that surfaces active conversations and fresh mentions within configurable time windows (24hr, 3-day, weekly). Develop hidden gems algorithm that identifies under-discovered but high-quality restaurants using criteria like low mention count but high average scores, new establishments with promising early indicators, and community consensus on quality despite limited exposure. Implement content curation pipeline with LLM-powered categorization, quality filtering, and diversity algorithms. Create recommendation engine with collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid approaches. Setup real-time trending detection with sliding window analysis and anomaly detection for viral content identification. Implement geographic discovery with location-aware recommendations and regional trending analysis. Create discovery API endpoints with pagination, filtering, and sorting capabilities. Design discovery metrics dashboard for monitoring algorithm performance and user engagement patterns.

# Test Strategy:
Verify discovery feed generates diverse, relevant recommendations based on user activity and preferences. Test trending analysis correctly identifies viral content with time-weighted scoring accuracy >85%. Confirm recently discussed content surfaces active conversations within specified time windows. Validate hidden gems algorithm discovers quality establishments with low mention counts but high scores. Test recommendation engine provides personalized results with >70% user satisfaction metrics. Verify geographic discovery filters content appropriately by location and distance. Confirm all discovery APIs respond within <2s for cached content and <5s for fresh analysis.
