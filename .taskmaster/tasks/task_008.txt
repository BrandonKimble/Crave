# Task ID: 8
# Title: Multi-Level Caching System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement comprehensive caching strategy with Redis for hot queries, recent results, and static data
# Details:
Setup Redis caching infrastructure with connection pooling and memory management. Implement three-tier caching: hot queries (1hr retention), recent results (24hr retention), static data (7+ days retention). Create cache invalidation strategy with time-based expiration and smart invalidation on entity updates. Implement cache hit/miss tracking and performance monitoring. Setup cache warming for predicted popular queries and geographic segmentation. Configure LRU eviction policies and appropriate memory limits. Integrate caching seamlessly into query pipeline.

# Test Strategy:
Achieve >85% cache hit rate on repeat queries, verify cached queries respond in <400ms, test cache invalidation works correctly, confirm memory usage stays within limits

# Subtasks:
## 1. Redis Infrastructure Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up Redis clusters with master-slave replication, configure connection pooling, and establish monitoring for high availability
### Details:
Configure Redis clusters with appropriate memory allocation, persistence settings, and replication. Set up connection pooling to handle concurrent requests efficiently. Implement health checks and failover mechanisms.

## 2. Three-Tier Caching Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Implement L1 (application), L2 (Redis), and L3 (CDN) caching layers with proper data flow and cache hierarchies
### Details:
Design and implement application-level caching (L1), Redis distributed caching (L2), and CDN edge caching (L3). Define cache key strategies, TTL policies, and data serialization formats for each tier.

## 3. Cache Invalidation Strategy [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Develop comprehensive cache invalidation patterns including event-driven invalidation, TTL management, and cache coherency mechanisms
### Details:
Implement cache invalidation strategies using Redis pub/sub, database triggers, and application-level events. Design cache tagging system for efficient bulk invalidation and ensure data consistency across all cache tiers.

## 4. Performance Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Set up comprehensive monitoring for cache hit rates, response times, memory usage, and cache effectiveness metrics
### Details:
Implement monitoring dashboards for cache performance metrics, set up alerting for cache misses and high latency, and create automated reporting for cache optimization insights. Include Redis-specific metrics and custom application metrics.

## 5. Cache Warming with Geographic Segmentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.3, 8.4
### Description: Implement cache warming strategies with geographic data distribution and regional cache optimization
### Details:
Design cache warming processes that pre-populate frequently accessed data based on geographic regions. Implement geo-distributed cache strategies, regional failover mechanisms, and optimize cache warming schedules based on usage patterns and time zones.
