# Task ID: 3
# Title: NestJS Backend Foundation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Setup NestJS backend with modular monolith architecture and core infrastructure modules
# Details:
Initialize NestJS application with Fastify adapter for performance. Implement modular monolith structure with domain-separated modules: content-processing, search-discovery, user-experience, external-integrations, and infrastructure. Setup dependency injection container, configuration management with @nestjs/config, logging with winston, security with helmet and rate limiting. Configure Bull queues for background processing, Redis caching layer, and basic health check endpoints. Implement authentication scaffolding with Passport.js and JWT strategy.

# Test Strategy:
Verify all modules load correctly, test dependency injection works across modules, confirm Redis connection and Bull queues operational, validate authentication endpoints respond correctly
