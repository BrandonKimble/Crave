# Task ID: 14
# Title: Advanced Search and Premium Features System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 9, 10
# Priority: low
# Description: Build comprehensive advanced search capabilities and premium features including complex multi-attribute queries, smart alerts, personal food maps, and neighborhood insights for premium users. This is a nice-to-have feature set that should be implemented after core application functionality is complete.
# Details:
Implement advanced search engine with complex multi-attribute query support allowing users to combine multiple criteria (cuisine type + price range + dietary restrictions + ambiance). Build smart alerts system that monitors user-defined criteria and sends notifications when new content matches their interests. Create personal food maps feature that allows users to save and organize discoveries geographically with custom tags and notes. Develop neighborhood insights analytics that provides demographic data, trending cuisines, price analysis, and discovery patterns for specific areas. Implement premium feature gating with subscription tier validation. Create advanced query builder UI with natural language processing for complex searches like 'romantic Italian restaurants under $50 with outdoor seating near downtown'. Build alert management dashboard where users can create, edit, and manage multiple alert configurations. Implement map visualization with clustering, heat maps, and custom markers for personal collections. Add neighborhood analytics dashboard with charts showing cuisine diversity, price distributions, popularity trends, and user activity patterns. Include export functionality for personal maps and search results. Setup caching layer for complex analytical queries and real-time alert processing pipeline. These features represent enhancement opportunities once the core application is stable and feature-complete.

# Test Strategy:
Verify complex multi-attribute queries return accurate results with proper filtering and ranking. Test smart alerts trigger correctly when new content matches user criteria within 5 minutes of content processing. Confirm personal food maps save locations with custom metadata and display correctly on interactive maps. Validate neighborhood insights generate accurate analytics from aggregated data with proper privacy protection. Test premium feature access controls properly restrict functionality based on subscription status. Verify alert management interface allows full CRUD operations on alert configurations. Confirm map visualizations render efficiently with 1000+ locations and clustering works properly. Test analytics dashboards load within 3 seconds and display accurate trend data.
