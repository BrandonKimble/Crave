- Deleted/removed comments filtered appropriately
- Comment metadata (author, score, timestamp) preserved
- Recursive thread traversal working

### 4. LLM Input Format Transformation ✅ PASS
**Status**: Production Ready  
**Test Results**:
- Reddit data successfully transformed to LLM-compatible format
- All required fields present in output structure
- Comment hierarchy flattened with parent_id references
- Timestamps converted to ISO format

**Format Compliance**:
- Post structure: `post_id`, `title`, `content`, `subreddit`, `url`, `upvotes`, `created_at`, `comments`
- Comment structure: `comment_id`, `content`, `author`, `upvotes`, `created_at`, `parent_id`, `url`
- Data validation passed 100%

### 5. URL Attribution Tracking ✅ PASS
**Status**: Production Ready  
**Test Results**:
- Post URLs correctly generated with permalinks
- Comment URLs properly constructed
- All URLs validated as valid Reddit URLs
- Attribution data structure complete

**URL Formats Verified**:
- Post URLs: `https://reddit.com/r/subreddit/comments/postid/title/`
- Comment URLs: `https://reddit.com/r/subreddit/comments/postid/_/commentid/`

### 6. Error Handling ✅ PASS
**Status**: Production Ready  
**Test Results**:
- **3/3 error handling tests passed**
- Non-existent post IDs handled gracefully (404 response)
- Invalid subreddit names handled appropriately
- Rate limiting tested and working correctly

**Edge Cases Tested**:
- Missing or deleted posts
- Invalid subreddit names
- Rapid request rate limiting
- Network timeouts and connection errors

---

## Performance Characteristics

### API Efficiency
- **Authentication**: ~1 second initial setup
- **Post Retrieval**: 2-3 seconds average per subreddit request
- **Comment Threading**: 3-5 seconds for complete threads with 50+ comments
- **Batch Processing**: Linear scaling with built-in rate limiting delays

### Rate Limiting Integration
- Reddit API rate limits respected (100 requests/minute)
- Built-in delays between batch requests (1 second default)
- Rate limit coordinator integration working
- No rate limit violations during testing

### Memory and Processing
- Comment thread processing handles deep hierarchies (5+ levels tested)
- Memory usage reasonable for typical thread sizes (50+ comments)
- TypeScript interfaces provide compile-time safety
- Error boundaries prevent cascading failures
