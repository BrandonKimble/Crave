## VALIDATION PHASES

### Phase 1: Current Integration State Assessment

**Read Current E2E Status:**
- Read current milestone's `M##_E2E_Testing_Status.md` from `.simone/02_REQUIREMENTS/M##_Milestone_Name/` (create if missing)

- Understand current system capabilities and integration points

**Assess Sprint Integration State:**
- Based on ALL sprint tasks read, identify complete data flows and service integrations implemented
- Map how services work together to deliver end-to-end user journeys
- Identify critical integration points that must be tested with real data
- Plan comprehensive E2E scenarios that validate the complete sprint implementation as integrated system
- Reference PRD requirements to ensure E2E testing covers all specified integration points and user journeys

### Phase 2: Comprehensive Real Data Integration Testing

**Setup Production-Like Environment:**
- Use real API keys, tokens, and authentication for live service calls
- Configure realistic network conditions and resource constraints
- Test with production-scale data volumes and authentic load patterns

**Execute Complete E2E Scenarios:**
- **Cross-Service Data Flow**: Test complete user journeys across all implemented services
  - Reddit data → LLM processing → Database storage → API responses
  - Google Places integration with location processing
  - Any other service integrations with real data flows

- **User Experience Validation**: Test realistic scenarios with actual app workflows
  - Complete food discovery journeys with real restaurant/dish data
  - User search queries with authentic Reddit community responses
  - Seamless experience across all touchpoints

- **System Integration Points**: Test all integration points with real data
  - Database operations with realistic volumes and query patterns
  - Caching, queueing, and async processing under production-like loads
  - Monitoring, logging, and error tracking with real system behavior

### Phase 3: Performance & Resilience Validation

**Performance Testing:**
- Test sustained load across all services with realistic usage patterns
- Measure actual performance under expected peak loads
- Identify bottlenecks and scalability limits using real scenarios
- Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory, network) under integrated loads
- Validate cost implications of real usage patterns

**Resilience Testing:**
- Test network failures, API outages, and service unavailability
- Validate retry logic, circuit breakers, and fallback mechanisms
- Test data corruption, partial failures, and recovery scenarios
- Test real edge cases and boundary conditions with actual production data
- Verify graceful handling of unexpected data formats from external APIs

## ISSUE RESOLUTION GUIDANCE

**For Each Integration Issue Found:**

1. **Document the Discovery**:
   - What integration assumption was incorrect?
   - What real-world condition caused the issue?
   - How does this affect complete user journeys with real data?

2. **Assess System Impact**:
   - Does this affect core E2E functionality?
   - What is the user experience impact?
   - Are there security or data integrity risks?

3. **Plan Resolution**:
   - Can this be fixed within current PRD scope?
   - Does this require architectural changes across services?
   - What is the effort and timeline for resolution?

4. **Iterate and Re-validate**:
   - Implement fixes focusing on seamless integration
   - Re-test with the same real data E2E scenarios
