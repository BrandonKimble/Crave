## DETAILS on every TODO item

## 1 · Load context and PRD requirements

**Load Sprint and Milestone Context Comprehensively:**

**Parse current sprint and context:**

   - Read ALL subsections completely (e.g., section 4 = read 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.1.1, 4.1.2, etc.)

2. **Read CONTEXT PRD SECTIONS**: Locate and read ALL sections listed under "BROADER CONTEXT" in the task  
   - Extract: Constraints, integration requirements, architectural context, dependencies
   - Read ALL subsections completely for full understanding

3. **Read ROADMAP SECTIONS**: Read PRD sections 9 and 10 completely
   - Extract: Scope boundaries, milestone context, what NOT to implement
   - Read ALL subsections within 9 and 10

**Gather Previous Task Context:**
- Read ALL task files in current sprint (both T## and TX## files) to understand complete implementation scope
- Extract: What services have been implemented, integration points created, data flows established
- Identify: API endpoints, database schemas, external integrations, processing pipelines built during sprint
- Map: Dependencies between tasks and how they work together as a unified system

**Gather Previous Milestone Context:**
- Read ALL milestone meta files from `.simone/02_REQUIREMENTS/` (M01, M02, etc.) up to current milestone
- Extract: Foundation services, core capabilities, architectural patterns established in previous milestones
- Identify: What infrastructure, services, and integrations are available from previous work
- Understand: How current sprint builds upon and integrates with existing foundation

## 2 · Assess Current Integration State

**Read Current E2E Status:**
- Read current milestone's `M##_E2E_Testing_Status.md` from `.simone/02_REQUIREMENTS/M##_Milestone_Name/` (create if missing)
- If starting new milestone and file doesn't exist, read previous milestone's E2E testing status for context
- Identify currently testable E2E scenarios with real data sources
- Map existing API integrations and data flows between services
- Understand current system capabilities and integration points

**Assess Sprint Integration State:**
- Based on ALL sprint tasks read, identify complete data flows and service integrations implemented
- Map how services work together to deliver end-to-end user journeys
- Identify critical integration points that must be tested with real data
- Plan comprehensive E2E scenarios that validate the complete sprint implementation as integrated system
- Reference PRD requirements to ensure E2E testing covers all specified integration points and user journeys

## 3 · Test Comprehensive Real Data Integration

**Setup Production-Like Environment:**
- Use real APIs, databases, and data sources
- Use real API keys, tokens, and authentication for live service calls
- Configure realistic network conditions and resource constraints
- Test with production-scale data volumes and authentic load patterns

**Execute Complete E2E Scenarios:**
- **Cross-Service Data Flow**: Test complete user journeys across all implemented services
  - Reddit data → LLM processing → Database storage → API responses
  - Google Places integration with location processing
  - Any other service integrations with real data flows

- **User Experience Validation**: Test realistic scenarios with actual app workflows
  - Complete food discovery journeys with real restaurant/dish data
  - User search queries with authentic Reddit community responses
  - Seamless experience across all touchpoints

- **System Integration Points**: Test all integration points with real data
  - Database operations with realistic volumes and query patterns
  - Caching, queueing, and async processing under production-like loads
  - Monitoring, logging, and error tracking with real system behavior

## 4 · Validate Performance & Resilience

**Performance Testing:**
- Test sustained load across all services with realistic usage patterns
- Measure actual performance under expected peak loads
- Identify bottlenecks and scalability limits using real scenarios
- Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory, network) under integrated loads
- Validate cost implications of real usage patterns

**Resilience Testing:**
- Test network failures, API outages, and service unavailability
- Validate retry logic, circuit breakers, and fallback mechanisms
- Test data corruption, partial failures, and recovery scenarios
- Test real edge cases and boundary conditions with actual production data
- Verify graceful handling of unexpected data formats from external APIs

**Integration Assessment:**
- Service coordination effectiveness with real data
- Data consistency across service boundaries
- Integration bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
- Edge cases discovered during real data testing

**User Experience Validation:**
- Complete food discovery journey performance
- Cross-service functionality and reliability
- Quality of recommendations with real data

## 5 · Provide production readiness verdict with technical account of validation testing, issues encountered, resolutions applied and actionable feedback

**Decision criteria:**

**✅ PRODUCTION READY - SEAMLESS INTEGRATION**
- All external integrations tested with **REAL APIS** and authentication across complete system
- Core E2E data processing validated with production-scale real datasets flowing through all services
- Cross-service performance meets requirements under realistic integrated load conditions
- Error handling proven effective with real failure scenarios across complete system
- Security and data integrity validated with real-world conditions
- Monitoring and observability working with real system behavior across all services
- Complete E2E user scenarios working with **REAL DATA** flows through entire system
- Resource usage and costs acceptable for production deployment
- Services work together effectively toward unified Crave app vision
- Complete user journeys align with seamless food discovery experience goals
- All components integrate without breaking existing functionality
**⚠️ MINOR INTEGRATION ISSUES**
- Most E2E scenarios work but minor performance issues exist
- Some integration edge cases need handling improvements
- Monitoring or logging needs enhancement
- Issues are non-blocking but affect system quality
**❌ MAJOR INTEGRATION ISSUES**
- Critical E2E functionality fails with real data across services
- Cross-service performance significantly below requirements
- Integration points unstable or unreliable
- Major error handling gaps in service communication
- Security or data integrity concerns
- Complete user journeys not ready for production deployment

**CRITICAL FINAL STEP:**
After completing all validation phases, **UPDATE** the milestone's `M##_E2E_Testing_Status.md` file in `.simone/02_REQUIREMENTS/M##_Milestone_Name/` with a detailed technical account of validation testing from beginning to end, including:

`.simone/99_TEMPLATES/milestone_e2e_testing_template.md`
